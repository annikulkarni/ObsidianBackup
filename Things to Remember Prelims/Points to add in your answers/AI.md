Japan's model of AI regulations
- This model rests on two key assumptions. First, that innovation ecosystems thrive better in the absence of rigid regulatory burdens. Second, that voluntary cooperation — when guided by national coordination and ethical principles — can effectively mitigate risks associated with the misuse of AI.
- The new AI law reflects a strategic choice to double down on science and technology as national growth drivers
- The world is watching to see whether Japan’s model of responsibility without rigidity can truly offer a sustainable and scalable path forward. If it succeeds, it could offer a compelling alternative to both laissez-faire deregulation and enforcement-heavy regimes
