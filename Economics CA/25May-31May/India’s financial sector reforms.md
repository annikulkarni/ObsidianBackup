## **major structural issues**

- **Fragmented Nomination Rules Across BFSI Sectors: Inconsistent nomination rules** in **banks**, **mutual funds**, and **insurance** create confusion and legal disputes
- The **bond market** remains **shallow**, **illiquid**, and lacks **transparency**, increasing the **cost of capital** for businesses.
- **NBFCs** and **brokers** offer **bank-like services** without full **regulatory supervision**, exposing the system to **financial risks**.

#### **harmonized nomination framework across BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) verticals necessary**

Different sectors (banks, mutual funds, insurance) treat nominees differently

Inconsistent rules create **loopholes** that can be exploited by unscrupulous actors to **divert funds** or delay inheritance.

A **uniform nomination system** makes it easier for ordinary people to **understand, update, and track** their financial nominations.

## **corporate bond market benefit India’s economy**

A deep bond market enables companies to raise funds at **competitive interest rates**, reducing their dependence on bank loans.

Large firms like **NTPC** or **Reliance** can raise capital directly from investors through bonds, easing pressure on public sector banks.

Corporate bonds are ideal for funding **long-gestation projects** like highways, power plants, and green energy, attracting **pension funds and insurance firms**.Countries like **South Korea and Malaysia** have developed strong bond markets

**Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** RBI regulates **Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)**

**Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI):** SEBI oversees **brokers, margin lenders, and mutual funds** that may engage in shadow banking-like activities, ensuring transparency in trading and lending practices.

The Ministry designs **regulatory frameworks and inter-agency coordination**, enabling RBI and SEBI to monitor and respond to emerging risks in shadow banking.

## **Way forward:**

**Unified and Risk-Based Regulatory Framework:** Adopt a **harmonised, activity-based regulation** where entities performing similar financial functions are subjected to **similar oversight**, regardless of their institutional form


**Enhanced Supervisory Capacity and Real-Time Monitoring:** Strengthen **inter-agency coordination** (RBI, SEBI, Ministry of Finance) and invest in **AI-powered data analytics**to track complex transactions and hidden risks.
