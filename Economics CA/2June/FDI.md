- India received a record **$81 billion** in gross FDI in 2024-25, indicating strong **headline interest** from foreign investors.
- Net FDI dropped to only **$353 million**, showing that much of the incoming investment is offset by **capital outflows**, weakening the real impact on the economy. _Eg:_ Rising **outward FDI** and **disinvestment** reduced net foreign capital retained in India.
- **Declining FDI-to-GDP ratio**: The gross inflow-to-GDP ratio fell from **3.1% (2020-21) to 2.1% (2024-25)**, and net FDI-to-GDP fell from **1.6% to near zero**, reflecting a **slowing domestic investment environment** despite high gross inflows. _Eg:_ This signals **tepid corporate investment** and **cautious investor sentiment** in India.

## **What is  Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC)?**

- **Private Equity (PE)** refers to investment funds that buy **existing companies** or large stakes in businesses, often to improve their performance and later sell them for profit. PE typically invests in more mature companies.
- **Venture Capital (VC)** is a type of financing that supports **early-stage startups** and small businesses with high growth potential. VC investors take higher risks in exchange for potentially high returns.

## A cause of concern
- **PE/VC-driven FDI focuses on brownfield investments**: These funds mainly acquire existing firms rather than creating new production capacity, limiting contributions to **capital formation** and **technology acquisition**. _Eg:_ Investments by Blackstone in Care Hospitals and ChrysCapital in Lenskart.
- PE/VC funds typically have a **3-5 year** exit strategy, often selling holdings during stock market booms, which leads to **disinvestment**
- focus on services like fintech and retail rather than manufacturing or infrastructure, they contribute less to **enhancing India’s productive capacity**

## **India is used for tax arbitrage**

- India shows a strong link between the money flowing in and out, suggesting that funds often **enter and exit quickly** rather than being invested long-term.
- A significant portion of both inward and outward FDI involves countries like **Singapore and Mauritius
- Research shows India ranked 6th among emerging markets for such correlated FDI flows, indicating use as a conduit for tax optimization.

## **declining FDI-to-GDP and GFCF ratios**

Declining **FDI-to-GDP** and **FDI-to-GFCF (Gross Fixed Capital Formation)** ratios indicate that foreign investments are becoming a smaller part of India’s overall economy and capital investment, potentially slowing down **industrial expansion** and **technology adoption**.

The downward trend signals **tepid domestic corporate investment** and reduced foreign investor interest, which can affect job creation and long-term economic stability. _Eg:_ Net FDI relative to GDP has declined from 1.6% in 2020-21 to nearly zero in 2024-25, showing declining investor enthusiasm.

- Current regulations allow large volumes of **inward and outward FDI**through **tax havens**, enabling **tax optimization** rather than genuine investment
- Reform is needed to encourage FDI that contributes to **capital formation**, **technology acquisition**, and **industrial growth** rather than short-term **PE/VC-driven disinvestment**
- Encourage FDI in new capacity building, manufacturing, and technology sectors over short-term PE/VC deals to boost capital formation
