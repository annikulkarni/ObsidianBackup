- India received a record **$81 billion** in gross FDI in 2024-25, indicating strong **headline interest** from foreign investors.
- Net FDI dropped to only **$353 million**, showing that much of the incoming investment is offset by **capital outflows**, weakening the real impact on the economy. _Eg:_ Rising **outward FDI** and **disinvestment** reduced net foreign capital retained in India.
- **Declining FDI-to-GDP ratio**: The gross inflow-to-GDP ratio fell from **3.1% (2020-21) to 2.1% (2024-25)**, and net FDI-to-GDP fell from **1.6% to near zero**, reflecting a **slowing domestic investment environment** despite high gross inflows. _Eg:_ This signals **tepid corporate investment** and **cautious investor sentiment** in India.
