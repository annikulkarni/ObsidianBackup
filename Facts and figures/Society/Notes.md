- The Economic Survey 2025-26 reports that Indian pension assets amount to just 17% of GDP, compared with up to 80% in many advanced economies.
- Currently, only around 12% of India’s workforce is covered by formal pension schemes.
- By 2050, over 800 million people, about half the population, will live in cities, making India the largest driver of global urban growth.
- Because women are not just half the population — we are half the potential. And it's high time India sees us that way.
