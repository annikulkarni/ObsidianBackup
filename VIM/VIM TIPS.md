Here’s a comprehensive list of Vim navigation techniques mentioned in the Reddit thread to help you move more efficiently and reduce reliance on h, j, k, l motions, thereby minimizing the risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI):
Line-Based Navigation

    Basic Line Motions:
        0: Move to the first character of the line.
        ^ or _: Move to the first non-whitespace character of the line.
        $: Move to the end of the line.
    Word-Based Motions:
        w: Move forward to the start of the next word.
        b: Move backward to the start of the previous word.
        e: Move to the end of the current or next word.
        3w, 4b, etc.: Use a number prefix to jump multiple words (e.g., 3w moves three words forward).
        ;: Repeat the last f or F motion in the same direction.
        ,: Repeat the last f or F motion in the opposite direction.
    Character-Based Motions:
        f<character>: Move forward to the next occurrence of <character> on the current line.
        F<character>: Move backward to the previous occurrence of <character> on the current line.
        t<character>: Move forward to just before the next <character> on the current line.
        T<character>: Move backward to just after the previous <character> on the current line.

Vertical Navigation

    Line Number Navigation:
        gg: Move to the first line of the file.
        #G or :#: Move to line number # (e.g., 55G or :55 to go to line 55).
        G: Move to the last line of the file.
        :set relativenumber: Display line numbers relative to the cursor’s position, making it easier to jump with #j or #k (e.g., 5k to move 5 lines up).
        :set number or :set nu: Display absolute line numbers for reference.
        :set number relativenumber: Enable hybrid line numbers (current line shows absolute number, others show relative).
    Screen-Based Navigation:
        H: Move to the top ("High") of the visible window.
        M: Move to the middle of the visible window.
        L: Move to the bottom ("Low") of the visible window.
        zt: Scroll the screen so the cursor is at the top.
        zb: Scroll the screen so the cursor is at the bottom.
        zz: Center the screen on the cursor.
    Page Navigation:
        Ctrl-f: Scroll forward one full page.
        Ctrl-b: Scroll backward one full page.
        Ctrl-d: Scroll down half a page.
        Ctrl-u: Scroll up half a page.
        Ctrl-e: Scroll down one line.
    Paragraph and Block Navigation:
        {: Move to the previous paragraph or block (empty line or scope boundary, depending on file type).
        }: Move to the next paragraph or block.
        [{ or ]}: Move to the start or end of a code block (e.g., function or scope boundaries).
        ]m or [m: Move to the next or previous method start (useful in code with language-specific plugins).

Search-Based Navigation

    /<pattern>: Search forward for a pattern or text (use Enter to execute).
    ?<pattern>: Search backward for a pattern or text.
    n: Move to the next match in the search direction.
    N: Move to the previous match (opposite direction).
    *: Search forward for the word under the cursor.
    #: Search backward for the word under the cursor.
    :set incsearch: Enable incremental search to highlight matches as you type.
    :set hlsearch: Highlight all search matches in the buffer.

Jump Navigation

    Ctrl-o: Jump back to the previous cursor position in the jump list.
    Ctrl-i or Tab: Jump forward in the jump list.
    gd: Go to the definition of the word under the cursor (requires LSP or language support, e.g., for Python or C).
    gi: Go to the last insertion point.
    gr: Go to references (requires LSP or plugin support).
    Ctrl-]: Jump to the definition of a symbol using ctags.
    Ctrl-t: Return from a ctags jump.

Marks

    m<letter>: Set a mark at the current cursor position (e.g., ma sets mark "a").
    '<letter>: Jump to the start of the line of mark <letter> (e.g., 'a).
    `<letter>: Jump to the exact position (line and column) of mark <letter> (e.g., `a).
    Example: Use ma to mark a spot, navigate elsewhere, then 'a to return.

Delimiter and Scope Navigation

    %: Jump between matching delimiters (e.g., (), [], {}).
    vib: Select inside parentheses (visual mode).
    viB: Select inside curly braces (visual mode for code blocks).
    ]] or [[: Move to the next or previous scope boundary (e.g., function or class).

Number Manipulation

    Ctrl-a: Increment the next number on the current line (or under cursor).
    Ctrl-x or Ctrl-z: Decrement the next number on the current line.
    #Ctrl-a: Increment by # (e.g., 11Ctrl-a increments by 11).
    Works with hexadecimal numbers as well.

Folding

    :set foldmethod=indent: Enable folding based on indentation.
    Use j or k to move over folded sections (collapsed paragraphs or code blocks).
    zo: Open a fold.
    zc: Close a fold.

Miscellaneous Commands

    ZZ: Save the buffer and quit Vim (use with caution due to similarity to zz).
    :wq: Save and quit (alternative to ZZ).
    ciw: Change the entire word under the cursor (deletes word and enters insert mode).

Plugins and Tools

    Vim-Easymotion: Enhances navigation by allowing jumps to specific characters or words with visual cues.
        Set <Leader> to <Space> for easier access: let mapleader = "\<Space>".
        Example: <Space>s to trigger Easymotion search.
    QuickScope: Highlights optimal characters for f/F jumps to reduce keystrokes.
    Hop.nvim (Neovim): Similar to Easymotion for faster navigation.
    Leap.nvim (Neovim): Lightweight motion plugin for quick jumps.
    Vim-Hardtime: Temporarily disables h, j, k, l to force learning other motions.
    The Viminator: A Vim-based game for practicing motions (available at www.TheViminator.com).
    VimGolf: Online challenges to practice efficient Vim usage.
    Ctags: Generates tags for jumping to symbol definitions (Ctrl-] to jump, Ctrl-t to return).
        Run ctags . in the project directory to create tags.

Configuration and Workflow Tips

    Relative Line Numbers:
        :set relativenumber or :set rnu: Shows relative line numbers for easier vertical jumps (e.g., 5j to move 5 lines down).
        Combine with :set number for hybrid mode.
    Remapping for Efficiency:
        Remap Caps Lock to Escape or Ctrl to reduce finger stretching (e.g., on Linux or using AutoHotkey on Windows).
        Example: nnoremap ZZ zz to prevent accidental save-and-quit with Caps Lock.
        Remap Ctrl-c to act as Escape for convenience.
    Persistent Undo:
    vim

    set undofile
    set undodir=~/some/place/safe/be/careful
    set undolevels=10000
    set undoreload=50000
    Enables persistent undo across Vim sessions, reducing risk from accidental commands like ZZ.
    Keyboard Settings:
        Adjust keyboard repeat delay and speed in your OS for faster h, j, k, l when needed.
    Practice Strategy:
        Use a timer (e.g., 10 minutes daily) to focus on thoughtful motions rather than speed.
        Example: Instead of jjjwwww to reach a word three lines down, use 3j4w or /search-term.
        Temporarily disable h, j, k, l with :noremap h <Nop> (and similar for others) to force learning alternative motions.
        Watch tutorials, such as ThePrimeagen’s YouTube series, for advanced tips.
        Read Practical Vim - Edit Text at the Speed of Thought for in-depth motion guidance.

Software for Practice

    The Viminator: A free, Vim-based game for learning and practicing motions (www.TheViminator.com).
    VimGolf: Online platform with challenges to optimize keystrokes for specific tasks.
    Vim-Hardtime: Plugin that restricts repetitive use of h, j, k, l to encourage learning other motions.

Additional Notes

    Avoid overusing h, j, k, l to reduce RSI risk; combine motions like f, w, or search (/) for efficiency.
    Use :help motion.txt in Vim for detailed documentation on motions.
    Combine motions with operators (e.g., d{ to delete a paragraph, ciw to change a word) for powerful editing.
    Experiment with plugins like Easymotion or QuickScope to find what suits your workflow.
    Be cautious with ZZ (save and quit) due to its similarity to zz (center screen), especially if Caps Lock is on.

This list covers all techniques mentioned in the thread, organized for clarity. Practice these motions gradually to build muscle memory and improve efficiency. For further learning, check :help motion.txt, ThePrimeagen’s YouTube videos, or the book Practical Vim. If you want to focus on 

specific motions or plugins, let me know!
