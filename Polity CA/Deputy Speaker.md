Came up because 17th Lok sabha has not elected deputy speaker 

**Articles 93 and 94** require the Deputy Speaker to be elected **“as soon as may be”** and to hold office until **resignation, removal, or disqualification**. The prolonged vacancy violates this mandate, creating a **constitutional vacuum**

The Deputy Speaker’s post is traditionally given to an **Opposition member** to maintain **checks and balances**. Leaving it vacant concentrates power in the **ruling party**
