Made kanzi changes, added Fuel Value to state manager where afe units are handled for fuel
Convert STRING(INT(Value))
will convert float value incoming to int to make it integer and bind it back
We need to add it to all the values and not only for the intended state group because, it doesnt know what to do for others, it will get stuck to integer if you done add to others.
