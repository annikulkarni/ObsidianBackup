what is app_screens.xml here we define each screen, and we will define actions that are handled in it by adding traps, each trap will have a target 
datums are defined in component.xml

- In app_screens.xml of iod we have this screen called iod_ok_trip_button_reseting_handler, this is the one which handles resetting animation, 
- in hal buttons we have defined all the actions of the button like, hold, press, released, hold_2 seconds etc.,
- 


Need confirmation on when
Resetting is complete, but the user has not yet released the ok button, and warning is triggered,  Whether the resetting action done, or resetting is cancelled
