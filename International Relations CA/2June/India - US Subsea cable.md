**_Subsea cables_**_, which carry over_ **_95% of international data_** _and form the_ **_backbone_** _of_ **_global internet infrastructure_**_, are being recognized for their critical_ **_geostrategic value_**_._

_Efforts are being made by_ **_India_** _to_ **_diversify_** _its_ **_digital infrastructure_** _under the proposed_ <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**_TRUST framework</mark>_** _(Technology for Resilient, Open and Unified Security and Trust)._



## **Why are Subsea Cables crucial**

- Subsea cables carry **over 95% of international data traffic**, forming the **physical backbone** of the internet and digital economy. Securing these is vital for protecting **critical infrastructure**
- China’s **Digital Silk Road** is rapidly laying subsea cables across the Indo-Pacific, posing **geopolitical and cybersecurity concerns**.Eg: The upcoming India-U.S. trade agreement includes provisions for enhancing digital infrastructure as a counter to China’s presence in the Indo-Pacific.
- Joint efforts in building resilient cable systems support **broader technology cooperation** and **secure trade flows**


##  **TRUST framework**

- The **TRUST (Technology for Resilient, Open and Unified Security and Trust)** framework aims to build trusted digital ecosystems by reducing dependence on untrusted vendors and creating **secure, interoperable technology supply chains**.
- The framework acknowledges India’s potential as a **net security provider** in the Indo-Pacific, aligning with U.S. efforts to **de-risk strategic technologies** and build **redundancy in digital connectivity**.
- TRUST enables **concessional finance**, cybersecurity assistance, and encourages **American companies** to anchor digital infrastructure projects in India and the region. **Eg:** Under TRUST, Meta’s multi-year undersea cable investment project aligns with **U.S.-India strategic digital cooperation**.
## **Regional hub for subsea connectivity**

- India is centrally positioned between Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia, near key maritime choke points like the Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, and Bab-el-Mandeb, making it ideal for **global cable routes**. **Eg:** India can serve as a **transit junction** for Africa-Asia and Europe-Asia subsea cables.
- increase the number of landing stations beyond existing clusters to **reduce regional risk**

## Challenges

- Deploying subsea cables in India requires navigating a maze of over **50 clearances** across multiple **ministries** Eg: **customs**, **naval authorities**, and **telecom departments
- **Overconcentration of** **_Landing Stations_** 15 of 17 subsea cables land in **Mumbai**, despite India’s **11,098 km coastline**
- India depends on **foreign-flagged ships** for cable repairs, which take **3–5 months** to respond due to long travel times and **clearance delays**

## **Way forward:**
Simplify and streamline the complex licensing and clearance processes to attract greater investments
Develop Indian-flagged cable repair vessels and expand cable landing stations
