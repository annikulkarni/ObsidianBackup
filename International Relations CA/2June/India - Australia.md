Donald Trump’s deal-based approach to security have led to doubts being raised about America’s strong support for global alliances like NATO and Indo-Pacific ties

- Trump’s transactional approach and doubts over U.S. security guarantees create a **power vacuum**, pushing India and Australia to enhance **self-reliant regional security frameworks**.
- Both nations share concerns about **China’s assertiveness** and have a common interest in **upholding a rules-based Indo-Pacific order** Eg : military exercises like **Malabar and AUSINDEX**
- With the U.S. potentially pulling back, **middle powers** like India and Australia can take on more active roles in shaping the **regional security architecture**.

### Defence partnership

- India and Australia have institutionalised their defence ties through frameworks like the **Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) 2020** and the **2+2 Ministerial Dialogue** (launched in 2021)
- Practical collaboration has grown through agreements like the **Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA)**, enabling joint exercises, logistics sharing, and humanitarian missions
- Exercises like **AUSINDEX (Navy)**, **AUSTRAHIND (Army)**, and participation in **Malabar and Pitch Black**reflect deepening defence cooperation.

Upgrading the Defence Advisor ( DA ) role to a **one-star rank** signals that India values its growing defence relationship with Australia. Australia views India as a **“top-tier security partner”**

Currently held by a Navy officer, the DA position lacks **dedicated Army and Air Force support**, limiting joint-service engagement.

The same DA currently manages India’s engagement with **Pacific Island nations**, which need focused strategic attention.

## **defence cooperation areas need urgent focus**

- Move beyond Navy-centric cooperation to promote **joint operations** across the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
- India’s MRO (**Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul**) contracts with the **U.S. and U.K. navies** can be replicated with Australia to support regional maritime forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
- Encourage **working-level military exchanges**, war-gaming, and fellowships to build trust
