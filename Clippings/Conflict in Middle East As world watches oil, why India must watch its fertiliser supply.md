- serious issue is emerging in **fertiliser supply**,
- ## **What are the fertiliser security risks for India amid geopolitical conflicts?**
- India relies heavily on **fertiliser imports** from **Gulf countries**
- Strait of Hormuz
- **urea and DAP**,
- raise the prices of **natural gas** (used to produce urea)
- India imports **100% of MOP** (Muriate of Potash), including from **Belarus and Israel**
- ## **What lessons from the Russia-Ukraine crisis remain unaddressed?**
- India **still lacks a fertiliser buffer stock policy** or **minimum stocking norms**
- **30–45 days of operational stock** is inadequate to absorb external shocks.
- it **continues to rely heavily on Gulf countries**
- After disruptions in nitrogen and potash from Russia and Belarus, the current **dependence on Israel and Jordan for DAP**
- The policy response has focused more on **short-term procurement**
- ## **Why should fertilisers be part of India’s national security planning?**
- **Fertilisers** are essential for sustaining **agricultural output**
- Heavy reliance on **imports** from **unstable regions**
- Fertiliser **shortages** or **price hikes** raise **subsidy burdens**
- ## **What are the steps taken by the Indian government?**
- Reviving closed urea plants (e.g., **Gorakhpur**, **Sindri**, **Talcher**) to achieve **90% urea self-sufficiency** by 2025.
- Forming **long-term agreements** and **joint ventures** with countries like **Morocco (for phosphates)** and **Canada (for potash)**
- Implementing the **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** system for fertiliser subsidie
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Promoting **alternative fertilisers** like **Nano Urea** and encouraging balanced nutrient usage.</mark>
- ## **How can India build resilience in fertiliser supply chains? (Way forward)**
- Establish buffer stocks of key fertilisers like **urea, DAP, and MOP**
- Forge **long-term agreements** and **joint ventures** with stable countries
- alternative shipping route
