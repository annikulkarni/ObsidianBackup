- a span of a 40-year-old bridge collapsed in Vadodara, Gujarat
- ## **What causes recurring public infrastructure failures in India?**
- **Morbi suspension bridge (2022)** in Gujarat had **exceeded their intended lifespan**
- originally designed for **lower traffic volumes**
- Indrayani pedestrian bridge collapse in Pune (2024
- Lack of **routine inspections** and **maintenance**
- **Municipal and local bodies** often remain **understaffed** and **underfunded**
- **Mizoram railway bridge girder collapse (2023)**, **failure analysis reports**
- ## **What is Peri-urban infrastructure?**
- **Peri-urban infrastructure** refers to the **basic facilities and services** (like roads, bridges, water supply, drainage, electricity, etc.) found in the **transitional zones between urban and rural areas**.
- ## **Why is peri-urban infrastructure more prone to collapse?**
- Peri-urban areas often develop without **proper zoning laws**, **building codes**, or **infrastructure planning**.
- fall between **urban and rural governance structures**, leading to **confusion in responsibility**
- These areas lack **media attention** and **political pressure** seen in core urban centre
- Hyderabad’s outer zones
- ## **How can AMRUT and UIDF improve asset upkeep?**
- **AMRUT 2.0** prioritizes the **retrofitting of old urban infrastructure** such as **pipelines, water supply**,
- **UIDF** provides **low-cost loans** to **Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities** that often lack **budgetary resources** for upkeep.
- Both schemes encourage the use of **geo-tagging** and **digital tracking tools** to **monitor asset health**
- **Eg**: Cities like **Bhubaneswar** and **Surat** use AMRUT-linked **dashboards** to track **infrastructure health** and flag issues before **failures occur**.
- ## **What gaps delay audits and accountability post-collapse?**
- Multiple departments—**urban development**, **public works**, and **local bodies**
- often share responsibility for infrastructure.
- In high-profile accidents, **inquiries** are sometimes delayed
- ## **Way forward:**
- Create a dedicated, independent body responsible for conducting **post-collapse audits**
- Use **GIS mapping**, **IoT sensors**, and **AI-based predictive maintenance**
