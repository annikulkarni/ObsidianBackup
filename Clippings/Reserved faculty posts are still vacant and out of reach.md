##### - problem of unfilled reserved posts in academia
- **2,389 SC**, **1,199 ST**, and **4,251 OBC** faculty posts were vacant
- A **2023 UGC report** shows **30% of reserved posts are still unfilled**
##### - constitutional and policy framework
- **Article 15(4)** allows the State to make special provisions for **socially and educationally backward classes**(SEBCs), SCs, and STs.
- Article 15(5)
- including private unaided ones (except minority institutions)
- 93rd Constitutional Amendment
- reserve seats for OBCs in centrally funded higher education
- **(UGC)** enforces reservation policies for **faculty recruitment and student admissions**
- In **Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992)**, the Supreme Court upheld **reservations for OBCs** and imposed a **50% cap**
- Later adjusted with the 10% EWS quota under **103rd Constitutional Amendment (2019)** allowed reservation for **EWS**
##### - main barriers to filling reserved faculty posts in central universities
- operate with **high autonomy**, often leading to **non-compliance**
- **Selection committees**, often lacking **social diversity**
- may **reject qualified SC/ST/OBC**
- The shift to a **13-point roster** treats **individual departments** as the unit of recruitment, drastically **reducing reserved seats**,
- **Reserved category candidates** are mainly recruited for **junior roles**
##### - What is the 13-point roster system?
- The **13-point roster system** is a method introduced in 2018 by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for implementing **reservation in faculty recruitment** in higher educational institutions.
- The **13-point roster** treats **individual departments** as the unit of recruitment rather than the whole institution
- Due to **small faculty sizes**, **SC/ST reservations** are often **skipped** altogether
- ST candidates often get **no opportunity**
- unless **14 or more posts**
- This system **undermines constitutional goals** of **equitable representation**
- focusing on arithmetic rather than **affirmative action principles**.
##### - How does faculty underrepresentation impact inclusive education
- deprives students of relatable **mentors** and **role models**, affecting confidence and belonging
- A first-generation Dalit student may feel alienated in a classroom where **no faculty share similar social experiences**
- Faculty diversity enriches curricula by introducing **marginalised perspectives**
- Faculty imbalance undermines the **Constitutional vision of social justice**
- steps should be taken
- **strict implementation of reservation policies** through regular **audits**
- mandate annual reporting of filled vs. vacant reserved posts
- Replace or reform the **13-point roster** to treat the **entire institution** as the unit of reservation (like the older **200-point roster**)
