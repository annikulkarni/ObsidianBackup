- Maharashtra (38) and Gujarat (53) have made notable progress, while Punjab (98) and Haryana (106) still struggle.
- **Why is India’s Maternal Mortality Ratio still high despite better healthcare access?**
- MMR is significantly higher in Empowered Action Group (EAG)
- **Assam (167)** and **Madhya Pradesh (175)**,
- **Inadequate Functioning of FRUs (First Referral Units):** Many FRUs lack **specialists**, **blood banks**, and **operating theatres**.
- Delays in **seeking care**, **reaching hospitals**, and **receiving treatment**
- **How are the three key delays contributing to maternal deaths?**
- Families often fail to **recognise danger signs**
- Lack of **timely transportation** from **remote or rural areas**
- care may be **delayed** due to **absence of doctors**, **operation theatres**, or **blood supply**.
- | **What are First Referral Units (FRUs)?**  **First Referral Units (FRUs)** are **designated health facilities** equipped to provide **comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC)**. These units serve as the **first-level referral centres** for maternal and child health emergencies, especially in rural and underserved areas. |

- **How can FRUs be made more effective in reducing maternal deaths?**
- FRUs must be equipped with **qualified obstetricians**, **anaesthetists**, and **paediatricians**
- **operational operation theatres**, **blood banks**, and **24×7 emergency care** t
- ### **What lessons does the Kerala model offer for reducing MMR nationwide?**
- Kerala uses a **systematic review** process to study every maternal death
- **Eg**: Led by Dr. V.P. Paily, Kerala’s **Confidential Review Committee** analyses causes like hemorrhage, embolism, or surgical delay, enabling precise interventions.
- **emergency preparedness**, with **trained obstetricians**, well-equipped **operation theatres**, and availability of **blood banks**.
- **Way forward:**
- Ensure that all **First Referral Units (FRUs)** are fully staffed
- Implement **confidential maternal death reviews**, train healthcare personnel in **advanced obstetric practices**
