- **\[UPSC 2014\]** Some of the International funding agencies have special terms for economic participation stipulating a substantial component of the aid to be used for sourcing equipment from the leading countries. Discuss on merits of such terms and if, there exists a strong case not to accept such conditions in the Indian context.
- India’s development cooperation with the Global South has been steadily increasing over the years.
- India’s modes of cooperation with the Global South
- **Capacity Building:** Focuses on **training, education, and skill development** of human resources in partner countries.
- **Technology Transfer:** Sharing **India’s innovations, expertise, and cost-effective solutions** with Global South nations
- **Market Access:** Providing **duty-free and preferential access** to Indian markets for exports from developing nations. **Eg:** Under the **Duty-Free Tariff Preference (DFTP)** scheme, **least developed countries (LDCs)**
- **Grants: Non-repayable financial assistance** offered for key infrastructure or social sector projects. **Eg:** India provided **grants for building parliament**
- **Afghanistan** and **Mali**.
- **Concessional Finance (Lines of Credit – LoCs):** India extends **low-interest loans** to partner countries for development projects under the **IDEAS** (Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme).
- India extended **LoCs for railway projects in Africa** (like in Mozambique and Senegal)
- **Note**: **IDEAS** is a **flagship initiative of the Government of India** designed to promote development cooperation with partner countries, especially in the **Global South**, by extending **Lines of Credit (LoCs)** on concessional terms.
- relevance of Lines of Credit (LoCs) under IDEAS
- Many **partner countries in the Global South** are facing **sovereign debt crises**,
- India raised concerns over the **unsustainable debt levels** in **Africa** and **small island nations**,
- India borrows from **global capital markets** and extends credit at **concessional rates** under IDEAS, absorbing the **interest differential**.
- Fluctuations in **global interest rates** and **capital availability** have made it difficult to maintain concessional lending under predictable term
- **rising cost of borrowing post-COVID**, India finds it less viable to sustain **concessional credit lines**
- decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA) impacted global development finance
- ODA has dropped significantly from **$214 billion in 2023** to an expected **$97 billion**, a **~45% decline**,
- The **financing gap for SDGs** has widened, rising from **$2.5 trillion in 2015** to over **$4 trillion in 2024**.
- progress toward achieving the **2030 Agenda** remains **off track**
- The **shrinking flow of concessional finance** has made it harder for **debt-ridden nations** to access affordable funding
- What is Triangular Cooperation (TrC)?
- ***Triangular Cooperation (TrC)*** *is a development model that brings together* ***three key actors****:*
- A **traditional donor** from the **Global North** (e.g., Germany, Japan, USA)
- A **pivotal country** from the **Global South** with development experience (e.g., India, Brazil, Indonesia)
- A **partner country**, usually another **developing or least developed country**, which receives the support
- role of Triangular Cooperation (TrC)
- Triangular Cooperation brings together a **traditional donor from the Global North**, a **pivotal country from the Global South** (like India), and a **partner country** (often another developing nation)
- **shared learning**, mutual respect, and **context-specific solutions**.
- enables the **co-creation of development solutions** that are tailored to local needs
- TrC allows India to **leverage partnerships** with countries such as **Germany**, **UK**, **EU**, and **Japan** to implement projects in **third countries**
- partnerships through TrC to enhance its development diplomacy? (Way forward)
- India can collaborate with traditional donors like **Germany, Japan, the UK, and the EU** to implement **development projects**
- By combining **India’s technical expertise** with **Northern financial resources**, TrC enables **context-specific, demand-driven projects** in areas like **energy, health, and education**, aligning with India’s vision of a **Global Development Compact**.
