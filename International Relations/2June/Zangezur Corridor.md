- The Zangezur Corridor is a **proposed land route** through Armenia’s Syunik Province that would connect **Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan region**, cutting across Armenian land.
- Azerbaijan and Turkiye back the project. They want a **direct link** without Armenian border checks or customs interference.
- The corridor would be about **43–44 km long** and pass near the **Iran-Armenia border**, giving it high geopolitical value.
- **Azerbaijan** sees it as a **post-war right** after its win in the 2020 [Nagorno-Karabakh conflict](https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/azerbaijan-launches-crackdown-against-armenia/).
- **Turkiye’s Interest**: It wants to use this corridor as part of its **Middle Corridor project** to **connect with Central Asia and Europe** via land routes.
