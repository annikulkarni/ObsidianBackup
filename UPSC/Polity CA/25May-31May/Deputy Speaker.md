Came up because 17th Lok sabha had not elected deputy speaker and most probably will not for 18th too

**Articles 93 and 94** require the Deputy Speaker to be elected **“as soon as may be”** and to hold office until **resignation, removal, or disqualification**. The prolonged vacancy violates this mandate, creating a **constitutional vacuum**

The Deputy Speaker’s post is traditionally given to an **Opposition member** to maintain **checks and balances**. Leaving it vacant concentrates power in the **ruling party**

The Deputy Speaker ensures the **continuity of parliamentary proceedings** if the Speaker resigns or is incapacitated. Without a Deputy Speaker, a **constitutional crisis** could arise, disrupting **governance** and **legislative business**

## **significance of Deputy speaker

The **Deputy Speaker** presides over the **Lok Sabha** when the **Speaker** is absent, ensuring that **legislative business**continues smoothly without interruption

The Deputy Speaker plays a crucial role in maintaining **fairness** during **debates** and **sensitive discussions**, acting independently of the **ruling party’s influence**.

By convention, the Deputy Speaker is usually from the **Opposition**, which helps uphold the spirit of **power-sharing** and **checks and balances**

## **key duties**

The Deputy Speaker conducts and manages the proceedings of the House with the **same powers as the Speaker** during such times.

The Deputy Speaker chairs key committees like the **Private Member’s Bill Committee** and the **House Budget Committee**

he Deputy Speaker acts as a **neutral arbitrator**


This means the election should happen **immediately or without unreasonable delay** following the formation of the new Lok Sabha.

## **Way forward:**

-  To strengthen parliamentary democracy, the ruling party should adhere to the established convention of offering the Deputy Speaker post to an Opposition member. This would foster bipartisan cooperation, reinforce checks and balances, and promote harmonious functioning of the House.

- The government and all parliamentary parties should prioritize the election of the Deputy Speaker “as soon as may be” as mandated by Articles 93 and 94 to avoid constitutional vacuum
