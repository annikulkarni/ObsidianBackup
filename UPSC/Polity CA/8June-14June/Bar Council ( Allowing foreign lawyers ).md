- BCI Officially put into effect new rules “**_Bar Council of India Rules for Registration and Regulation of Foreign Lawyers and Foreign Law Firms_** in India.”
- The BCI is a **_statutory body_** established under the **Advocates Act, 1961** to regulate the legal profession and legal education in India.

- With growing **cross-border trade** and **legal demands**, there was a need to formally regulate how **foreign lawyers**operate in India. The rules provide a clear **framework for registration**, **scope of work**, and **ethical standards**.
- **Foreign law firms** advising **Indian clients** on **international mergers** or **arbitration cases** must now **register** and follow **BCI rules**
- rules were introduced to allow **foreign legal entry** based on **mutual terms**, ensuring **Indian lawyers** are treated fairly abroad Eg: Foreign lawyers are allowed only when Indian lawyers are also allowed to take up similar cases in foreign countries

#### Criticisms
- Mandatory disclosures and registration conditions are seen as restrictive and protectionist.
- reveal the “nature of legal work” and “client identity” allegedly conflicts with the American Bar Association (ABA) rules on client confidentiality
- The fly-in, fly-out rule imposes limits (e.g., 60 days stay) without ensuring similar access for Indian lawyers in the U.S.
- Legal services fall under **Entries 77 and 78 of the Union List**  (administration of justice and legal profession), not under trade and commerce entries. eg: In India UK Free trade agreement India intentionally excluded legal services, reinforcing this constitutional boundary
- In <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**Bar of Indian Lawyers vs D.K. Gandhi (2024)**</mark>, the court held that **legal services are distinct from trade or business**, confirming their exclusion from trade frameworks.

#### Balance between openness and standards
- Registration based model for foreign lawyers to operate in India - <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">regulated access</mark> , Rules 3 and 4 allow entry subject ot ethical and professional o
