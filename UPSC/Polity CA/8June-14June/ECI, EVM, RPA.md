#### Concerns
- Over **39 lakh new voters** were added within just six months after the general election
- The **Election Commission of India (ECI)** has not released **machine-readable data** to allow public or party-level verification.
-  The voter roll update process often excludes timely input from political parties

#### **CCTV Access**
- The **Centre’s amendment** to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 restricts access
- Without footage, it’s **difficult to verify allegations** of booth-level misconduct
- Lack of access is viewed as **eroding public trust** and weakening institutional checks

#### **What ECI Said**
-  The **Election Commission of India (ECI)** clarified that there was **no significant spike** in voter turnout after 5 p.m. during the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections.
- App-based data can differ from final turnout due to delays and entry errors during polling day. - those are manual inputs
- The accurate data comes from form 17C which is after the polling ends

#### Way forward

- Reconstitute the Election commission panel
