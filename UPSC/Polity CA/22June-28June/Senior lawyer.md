- This is contentious because it may lead to favouratism, inequality in legal profession

Legal issues
- based on vague terms **like “ability” or “standing at the Bar”**, which lack objective benchmarks.
-  **It** has been challenged as violative of **Article 14 (Right to Equality**
- **Rule 2 of Order IV** of the Supreme Court Rules allows for **pre-audience to senior advocates**, reinforcing hierarchical privilege
- **_Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India (2017)_**, the Court upheld the validity of **Section 16** but did not address how it leads to **systemic exclusion**

2025 Jitendar judgement
- court acknowledged that the current point based system is subjective, but still retained the application based process, 
- the Court left it to **High Courts** to frame rules, without tackling the core issue of **representation**.
- The process continues to **exclude women**, **Dalits**, and those from **less privileged background**

- Talented advocates in **lower courts** of **Bihar** or **Odisha** are often overlooked for **high-profile cases** or **designations**.
-  **rural** or **low-income backgrounds** often lack access to **top law schools** due to **language barriers**

forward
- **:** Expand access to **quality legal education** through scholarships, regional law schools, and skill-based training in **vernacular languages**,
- **merit-based, transparent system** for designating senior advocates
