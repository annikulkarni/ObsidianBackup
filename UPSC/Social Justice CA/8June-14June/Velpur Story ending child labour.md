- _June 12 is observed as the World Day Against Child Labour_ (WDACL) by ILO
- _an inspiring success story from India:_ **_Velpur Mandal in Telangana_**
- _remained_ **_child labour-free for over 20 years_**

#### Major challenges
- Low income families rely on children for their income, Eg: Sub saharan africa
- Lack of schools, infrastructure, hidden costs of travel, deter from attending schools Eg: Afghanistan
- weak legal enforcement in informal sectors where most of the child labour occurs 
- <mark class="hltr-red">Acceptance by society</mark>, livelihood and community, eg: working in beedi , carpet rolling
- Armed conflict, refugee crises, and natural disasters disrupt schooling and increase reliance on child labour for survival eg: syria

#### **national-level challenges in eliminating child labour**
- Economic hardship compels families to send children to work instead eg:Bihar, UP -> brik clins
- poor monitoring, corruption, and lack of coordination among departments, despite ban in child labour prohibitin Act children work in mica mines
- In Andhra pradesh beedi making is seen as a family tradition and social acceptance of children working in them 
#### **Who led the anti-child labour campaign in Velpur?**

The campaign was led by **the then District Collector of Nizamabad** along with committed local officials.
####   **How did it achieve child labour-free status?**

- **Community-Led Campaign and Awareness Drive:** A **100-day campaign** was launched in **2001** involving **local officials**, **sarpanchs**, **teachers**, **caste elders**, and **civil society**to identify and enroll every child into **school.** Eg: In **Velpur Mandal (Telangana)**, all **8,057 children** aged **5–15** were enrolled in **schools**, and the mandal was declared **child labour-free** by **October 2, 2001.**
- **Debt Waiver and Social Accountability by Employers:** Former **child employers** publicly waived **₹35 lakh** worth of **family debts** and provided **school supplies**, freeing children from **bonded labour.** Eg: Employers in **Velpur villages** forgave **loans** where children were used as **repayment guarantees**, helping families send their children to **school.**
- **Institutional Support and Bridge Schooling through NCLP:** Children withdrawn from labour were sent to **bridge schools** under the **National Child Labour Project (NCLP)** to ease their **transition into formal education.** Eg: Children from **beedi units** and **farms** were given **remedial education** and then enrolled into **regular schools** with full **retention** ensured by **community monitoring.**

#### Status of national child policy
 - It recognizes rights to survival, development , protection and participation, <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">it does not specifically address rehabilitation strategies</mark>
- Not aligned with child labour amendment<mark class="hltr-boom-bam">(Prohibition and regulation)</mark> act 2016, or with SDG 8.7 India aims to eliminate **child labour by 2025** under SDG 8.7
- The government had initiated a process to draft a **new National Child Policy in 2020**, but no final version has been released or implemented so far

#### Steps by GOI
- The **Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016** prohibits employment of children below 14 years and restricts adolescents (14–18 years) from hazardous occupations. Rescue of thousands of children from **beedi-making** and **fireworks units** in states like **Tamil Nadu and Telangana.**
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**National Child Labour Project (NCLP):** Launched in **1988**, this centrally sponsored scheme focuses on **identifying, rescuing, and rehabilitating child labourers**through **special training centres.**</mark>
- Programs like **Right to Education Act (2009)**, **Mid-Day Meal Scheme**, and **Samagra Shiksha** aim to improve school access and retention

#### Way forward
- Empower **panchayats**, **school management committees**, and **civil society** to track school dropouts
- Finalize and implement a **revised National Child Policy** aligned with **SDG 8.7**, and strengthen **rehabilitation measures**like skill development, financial support, and psychosocial care for rescued children.
