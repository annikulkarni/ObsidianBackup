- poor monitoring, corruption, and lack of coordination among departments, despite ban in child labour prohibitin Act children work in mica mines
- In Andhra pradesh beedi making is seen as a family tradition and social acceptance of children working in them 
#### **Who led the anti-child labour campaign in Velpur?**

The campaign was led by **the then District Collector of Nizamabad** along with committed local officials.
####   **How did it achieve child labour-free status?**

- **Community-Led Campaign and Awareness Drive:** A **100-day campaign** was launched in **2001** involving **local officials**, **sarpanchs**, **teachers**, **caste elders**, and **civil society**to identify and enroll every child into **school.** Eg: In **Velpur Mandal (Telangana)**, all **8,057 children** aged **5–15** were enrolled in **schools**, and the mandal was declared **child labour-free** by **October 2, 2001.**
- **Debt Waiver and Social Accountability by Employers:** Former **child employers** publicly waived **₹35 lakh** worth of **family debts** and provided **school supplies**, freeing children from **bonded labour.** Eg: Employers in **Velpur villages** forgave **loans** where children were used as **repayment guarantees**, helping families send their children to **school.**
- **Institutional Support and Bridge Schooling through NCLP:** Children withdrawn from labour were sent to **bridge schools** under the **National Child Labour Project (NCLP)** to ease their **transition into formal education.** Eg: Children from **beedi units** and **farms** were given **remedial education** and then enrolled into **regular schools** with full **retention** ensured by **community monitoring.**

#### Status of national child policy
 - It recognizes rights to survival, development , protection and participation, <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">it does not specifically address rehabilitation strategies</mark>
- Not aligned with child labour amend
