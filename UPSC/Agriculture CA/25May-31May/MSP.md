- in response to food shortages in the 1960s, notably during the **Bihar famine of 1966–1967**
-  **Agricultural Price Commission (APC)** -> Evolved into CACP  was established in **1965** to implement price policies like procurement at pre-decided prices and MSP.

## **Steps involved in Fixing MSPs:**

- Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) sends its recommendations to the **Government of India**.
- The reports are shared with **state governments** and **concerned central ministries** for comments.
- After reviewing all inputs, the **Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)** takes the **final decision** on MSPs.
- Once approved, **CACP publishes all its reports online**, ensuring **transparency** and explaining the **rationale behind its recommendations**.


- **Formulae for Calculation**:
    - **A2:** Costs incurred by the farmer in production of a particular crop. It includes several inputs such as expenditure on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, leased-in land, hired labour, machinery and fuel
    - **A2+FL:** Costs incurred by the farmer and the value of family labour
    - **C2:** A comprehensive cost, which is A2+FL cost plus <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">imputed rental value of owned land </mark>plus <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">interest on fixed capital</mark>,<mark style="background: FFFF2E;"> rent paid for leased-in land</mark>

- National Commission of Farmers also known as the **Swaminathan Commission (2004)** recommended that the MSP should **at least be 50 per cent more** than the **weighted average Cost of Production (CoP)**, which it refers to as the C2 cost.
- The government maintains that the MSP was fixed at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all-India weighted average CoP, but it **calculates this cost as 1.5 times of A2+FL**.
