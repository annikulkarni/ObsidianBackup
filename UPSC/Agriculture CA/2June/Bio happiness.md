The **fast loss** of **biodiversity** and **food knowledge**, caused by **cash crops**, **global diets**, and **weak policies**, urges India to use **new science** and revive **orphan crops**
## **Neglected and Underutilized Species**

NUS are traditional crops like **millets, legumes, tubers, and wild fruits** that have been largely ignored or underused in modern agriculture and food systems.

These species are **nutritionally rich**, **climate-resilient**
## **opportunity crops**

- These crops are rich in **essential nutrients**, **vitamins**, and **minerals**, making them excellent for improving **health**.
- **Small millets** are high in **fiber** and **micronutrients** compared to rice and wheat.
- They can withstand **harsh environmental conditions** like **drought** and **poor soils**, helping farmers adapt to **climate change ****Finger millet (ragi)** grows well in **dry** and **marginal lands**.
- These crops are naturally suited to **local soils** and **climates**, reducing the need for **chemical fertilizers** and **irrigation ***Eg :  Buckwheat** thrives in the **hilly regions**
- Cultivating these crops preserves **agrobiodiversity** and **traditional farming knowledge**, maintaining **ecological balance**. _Eg:_ Indigenous **legumes** help fix **nitrogen** in soil, improving **fertility** naturally.
- Reviving these crops can create new **market opportunities**, increase **farmers’ incomes**, and diversify **food production**

## **agrobiodiversity declining in Northeast India**


- Indigenous knowledge about the **nutritional** and **medicinal properties** of local plants is being lost as younger generations move away from **traditional lifestyles**. _Eg:_ **Nyishi** and **Apatani tribes’** understanding of **forest plants** is fading.
- Many native plant species are disappearing quickly due to changing **land use** and **environmental pressures**, **greens** and **wild fruits** once common in **Arunachal Pradesh** are becoming rare.
- In **Kolli Hills**, many farmers switched from **millets** to **coffee** and **pepper**. - moving to commercial crops
- **Forest degradation** in **Northeast India** is threatening native **biodiversity**. - climate change, habitat loss
- There is limited **awareness** and **institutional support** for conserving local **agrobiodiversity**, leading to neglect


### Efforts
- The **M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF)** has worked with local farmers for over 20 years to prevent millet diversity loss.
- _Eg:_ Farmers shifted back from cash crops to locally adapted **millets**.
- **Koraput District, Odisha:** Collaboration with the **Odisha Millet Mission** has supported a community-led millet revival
- _Eg:_ Minor millets are being reintroduced into local diets and markets.

## **few crops’ dominance**

- Global food systems mainly depend on **rice, wheat, and maize**, which provide over **50% of plant-based calories**.
