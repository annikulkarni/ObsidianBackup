increased by 48%, It has grown from **7,516 km** to **11,098 km**
#### What led the increase
- The shift from **low-resolution** (1:4,500,000) to **high-resolution data** (1:250,000) eg: **Modern GIS software** captured intricate
- Many **small offshore islands** that were earlier **not visible**
- measuring them at a **finer scale** captures more detail
- **Coastlines are highly irregular**, full of **bends, curves, and inlets**, which get missed at lower resolutions but captured at higher ones.
- The paradox proves that **coastlines do not have a finite length**—they can always be measured in more detail
