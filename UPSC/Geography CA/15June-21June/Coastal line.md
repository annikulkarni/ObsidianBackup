increased by 48%, It has grown from **7,516 km** to **11,098 km**
#### What led the increase
- The shift from **low-resolution** (1:4,500,000) to **high-resolution data** (1:250,000) eg: **Modern GIS software** captured intricate
- Many **small offshore islands** that were earlier **not visible**
- measuring them at a **finer scale** captures more detail
- **Coastlines are highly irregular**, full of **bends, curves, and inlets**, which get missed at lower resolutions but captured at higher ones.
- The paradox proves that **coastlines do not have a finite length**—they can always be measured in more detail

How does it impact governance and security
- Updated coastline data helps plan **coastal roads, ports**, and **disaster response systems** in states like **Gujarat** and **West Bengal**.
- enabling better **deployment of naval and coast guard resources**.**radar stations** and **surveillance posts** in regions like **Lakshadweep**and **Andaman & Nicobar**.

#### Challenges
- Some landforms may appear as **islands during high tide** but get connected to the mainland during low tide, coastal features in **Sundarbans** and **Gulf of Khambhat**
- **state governments**, **Coast Guard**, and **Surveyor General** have reported **varying island counts**


Adopt a **uniform classification system** for islands and coastlines
 **periodic reassessments** using **high-resolution GIS and satellite data** every 10 years.
 Develop a **centralized coastal database** linking administrative, ecological, and security data to support **policy-making**
