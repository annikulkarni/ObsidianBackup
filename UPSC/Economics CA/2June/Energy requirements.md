_India’s_ **_energy needs_** _will grow_ **_2.5 times_** _by_ **_2047_**_, and it will use_ **_25%_** _of the world’s_ **_new energy_**_._

## **Key components of India’s energy strategy**

- **Four-pronged approach**: a) **Diversification** of energy sources and suppliers, b) **Expansion** of domestic production, c) **Transition** to renewables, d) Ensuring **affordability** for citizens
- **Structural transformation**: Significant reforms in both **upstream and downstream** sectors, including new **revenue-sharing models**, **pricing reforms**, and **logistics integration**.
- **Digital mapping & infrastructure**: PM **Gati Shakti** digitally mapped over **1 lakh energy assets**, integrated with the **National Master Plan** for real-time visibility and route optimization.

## **Energy security** =  **development security** ?

- India’s rise to the 4th-largest oil consumer shows its energy needs
- access to affordable and sustainable energy strengthens **national resilience**, Eg: Ethanol blending (19.7% in 2025) and expanding biofuels have saved ₹1.26 lakh crore in foreign exchange
- Under PM Ujjwala Yojana, LPG cylinder prices for beneficiaries remain at ₹553 despite a global 58% rise, ensuring energy access for the poor.

## **Domestic oil and gas exploration acreage from 2021 to 2025**

- India increased its **exploration area** from **8% in 2021 to 16% in 2025**, aiming to cover **1 million sq km by 2030** to unlock vast **hydrocarbon resources**
- Reforms such as reducing **‘No-Go’ zones by 99%** and streamlining licensing through the **Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP)**
- New **pricing mechanisms** link gas prices to **10% of the Indian crude basket** with a **20% premium for new wells**, and **revenue-sharing contracts** allow shared infrastructure, boosting **investment incentives**

## **Renewable energy initiatives**

- Ethanol blending increased from **1.5% in 2013 to 19.7% in 2025**, expanding the ethanol supply from **38 crore litres to 484 crore litres**
- The **SATAT** program has commissioned over **100 CBG plants** and targets a **5% CBG blending mandate by 2028**
- India has produced **8.62 lakh tonnes** of green hydrogen and awarded **3,000 MW electrolyser tenders**

## Challenges

Limited **infrastructure** for large-scale **production, storage, and distribution** of renewables like **green hydrogen** and **biofuels**

Securing consistent and diversified **feedstock** for biofuels like **ethanol** and **CBG** is challenging due to **agricultural dependencies**

**Capital-intensive** nature of renewable projects and lack of affordable **financing options** can hinder **MSMEs** and smaller players from scaling up. Eg: Limited access to **credit** for startups working on cutting-edge **green hydrogen technologies**.
