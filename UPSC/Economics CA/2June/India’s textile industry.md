### Challenges

- Rising **global conflicts** and **trade restrictions** disrupt **export routes**
- The **U.S.-China trade war** shifted demand to countries like **Vietnam**
- During the **COVID-19 pandemic**, uncoordinated lockdowns at different **supply chain** points delayed **delivery timelines**. - lack of coordination between weavers, suppliers and exporterse
- Unpredictable fluctuations in **raw material prices** reduce **planning efficiency** and shrink **profit margins**
- Indian firms may struggle to provide eco-friendly textiles without investing in **green technology** - EU's policy of traceability and environmental standards - affect Indian exports
- International buyers now prioritize **ethically sourced**, **durable**, and **sustainably certified** products

<mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**Regenerative farming**</mark> is an agricultural practice focused on **restoring and enhancing soil health**, **increasing biodiversity**, and **improving ecosystem resilience**. It goes beyond sustainable farming by actively **repairing environmental damage** caused by conventional agriculture.

- <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">In **Aurangabad**, Maharashtra, over **6,000 farmers** under the **Regenerative Cotton Program** reported higher yields and soil health improvement.</mark>
- improves **soil health** and enhances resistance to **climate shocks**, ensuring **consistent fibre quality**.
- Reduced dependence on **chemical inputs** lowers **input costs**, making raw materials more **affordable** for textile producers.
- enables **real-time data** and **certification**, ensuring **supply chain transparency** demanded by global brands
- It creates **inclusive rural economies** by empowering **smallholders**, supporting **gender equity**
## **traceability boost textile exports**

- **Traceability** ensures transparency from **raw material to final product**, building **consumer trust** in international markets
- Export destinations demand **eco-conscious sourcing**. Traceable supply chains show alignment with **sustainability standards**.**Eg**: The **EU and U.K.** emphasize **environmentally responsible production** under FTAs and **Digital Product Passports (DPPs)**.
- meet **foreign regulatory standards**, easing entry into **eco-sensitive markets**.
- raceable products stand out in global markets with rising demand for **ethical fashion**.

### Steps by GOI

- <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**PM MITRA Scheme</mark>:** Establishes **Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks** to integrate the entire **textile value chain**, reduce **logistics costs**, boost **competitiveness**, and create **jobs**.
- Supports <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**sustainable farming practices**</mark> to improve **soil health**, reduce **chemical use**, and enhance **cotton quality**through **collaborative platforms**.
- <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**National Technical Textiles Mission**</mark> to promote **R&D** and commercialization

### Way forward

- Invest in **R&D**, encourage **public-private partnerships**, and leverage **trade agreements**
- Promote widespread use of **regenerative farming**, **traceability technologies**, and **product circularity**
