India’s rooftop solar (RTS) capacity has gone beyond 17 GW

BIPV refers to the integration of photovoltaic materials directly into the building envelope (e.g., façades, roofs, windows). It serves both as a **building material** and a **solar power generator**. **Eg**: Façades, curtain walls, glass windows, skylights, tiles, railings, balconies, canopies, atriums, and shading devices.

A 16-storey building with a 4,000 sq. ft rooftop can install only a **40 kWp RTS system**, but its south-facing façade can support **150 kWp BIPV** panels.

Façade areas of buildings are often **3–4 times larger than rooftop areas**

BIPV enables renewable energy adoption in future infrastructure. _Eg_: Integration of BIPV in new public infrastructure

The **Renewable Energy Museum in Kolkata** has a solar-powered dome with over 2,000 integrated panels

## Challenges

- **BIPV systems** are more expensive than traditional rooftop
- Lack of **clear policies**, **mandates**, and **incentives** specific to BIPV, **Europe’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive** promote BIPV
- Specialised **BIPV glass panels** or **semi-transparent modules** are often **imported**
- There are no **clear standards**, **benchmarks**, or **guidelines** for **BIPV performance**, **quality**, and **installation**

## Measures

- Under the **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (2024)**, BIPV was included with subsidies up to **₹78,000** for a 3-kW residential system. Similar support is needed for **commercial and industrial sectors**.
- Integrating BIPV requirements into the **National Building Code**, **Energy Conservation Building Code**, and **Eco Niwas Samhita**
- Boosting **indigenous production** through **PLI schemes**, along with **pilot projects** in public infrastructure
- The **CtrlS Datacenters in Navi Mumbai** and **Kolkata’s Renewable Energy Museum** show how BIPV can be scaled in real-world infrastructure.
