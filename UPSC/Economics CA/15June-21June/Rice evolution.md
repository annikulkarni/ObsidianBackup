scientists proved that cold exposure in rice plants can cause changes that improve stress tolerance and are inherited by the next five generations

#### **Lamarck’s theory of acquired characteristics**(1809)
-  **When the traits developed during an organism’s lifetime** due to **use, disuse**, or **environmental influence** could be **inherited by its offspring**. Eg: **A giraffe stretching its neck** to reach higher leaves would result in its offspring having **longer necks**.

#### Later scientific theories challening this

- **Weismann’s Tail-Cutting Experiment**: demonstrated that acquired traits are not inherited, by cutting tails of rats for 5 generations, and the offspring still had a tail 
- Gregor Mendel showed that traits are inherited through <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**stable units (genes)** </mark>passed unchanged from parents to offspring Eg: pea plants, traits like flower colour were inherited predictably,
- The discovery of **DNA as the genetic material** and that **mutations** cause heritable changes explained inheritance scientifically

#### **Mendel’s work and DNA discovery change heredity understanding**
- Mendel’s experiments introduced the concept of **“genes” as stable, particulate units** of inheritance passed from **parents to offspring**
- **alleles segregate independently**, ensuring **genetic variation** without influence from acquired traits. **Eg**: A plant with one **tall** and one **short gene** could pass either to its offspring, not a mix of the two.
- **Eg**: **Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty’s experiments** in 1944 showed that **DNA—not proteins**—was responsible for heredity.
- **sickle cell anemia**, a heritable disorder caused by mutations not acquired

#### Cell study on cold tolerant rice
- **cold exposure triggered an epigenetic modification** (methylation) in rice plants, which was **inherited for five generations**, without any DNA sequence change.
- **gene expression** can be regulated by **epigenetic marks** rather than genetic mutations eg: The **ACT1 gene** stayed active in cold-tolerant rice due to the **absence of a methylation tag**
-  **non-genetic crop adaptation methods** to deal with **climate change**

#### Way forward
- Government research bodies and agricultural universities should integrate **epigenetic trait selection and editing** into mainstream
- Increase funding for **long-term, controlled environment trials** to identify and stabilize **heritable epigenetic traits**
