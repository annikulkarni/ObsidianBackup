scientists proved that cold exposure in rice plants can cause changes that improve stress tolerance and are inherited by the next five generations

#### **Lamarck’s theory of acquired characteristics**(1809)
-  **When the traits developed during an organism’s lifetime** due to **use, disuse**, or **environmental influence** could be **inherited by its offspring**. Eg: **A giraffe stretching its neck** to reach higher leaves would result in its offspring having **longer necks**.

#### Later scientific theories challening this

- **Weismann’s Tail-Cutting Experiment**: demonstrated that acquired traits are not inherited, by cutting tails of rats for 5 generations, and the offspring still had a tail 
- Gregor Mendel showed that traits are inherited through **stable units (genes)** passed unchanged from parents to offspring Eg: pea plants, traits like flower colour were inherited predictably,
