<mark style="background: FFFF2E;">a new plan</mark> called the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India
	- Import duty cut to 15% for fully built electric cars ( 8000 units per year )
	- must invest at least **₹4,150 crore over 3 years**
	- Companies must achieve **25% Domestic Value Addition (DVA)** within 3 years, increasing to **50% in 5 years**


## **technology transfer critical**

- India risks falling behind in **innovation** and **manufacturing capabilities**. - late start
- China’s **vertical integration** from mining to battery assembly gave it a competitive edge in **pricing** and **scale**. - India currently lacks the technology to produce **advanced batteries**domestically.
- helps develop **local suppliers** and **skilled workforce**.
- success in **ICE vehicles** - **joint ventures** which facilitated **tech** and **skill transfer**; the same model can be applied to EVs.

- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**New Energy Vehicle subsidy programme**</mark> in **2009**- Subsidies encouraged companies like **BYD** and **NIO** to rapidly scale EV
- Required foreign EV manufacturers to form **joint ventures** with Chinese firms until **2022** - Tesla
- China invested around <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**$230 billion**</mark> over 15 years on EV subsidies, infrastructure, and research
- Reduced import duties on EVs from **25% in 2010 to 15% in 2018**
- Controls entire **battery value chain**: mining, processing, manufacturing, and assembly - **CATL** ( battery company dominate globally )

## GOI

- **Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME)** scheme
	- 2015 with ₹895 crore outlay
	- expanded to ₹10,000 crore in 2019
	- EV adoption through subsidies and incentives
- Caps on imported EVs to encourage domestic production
- Push for **localisation of components**

### Way forward

- **Promote Strategic Partnerships for Technology Transfer:**- joint ventures
- **Comprehensive Domestic Battery Ecosystem**- end-to-end battery manufacturing capabilities
