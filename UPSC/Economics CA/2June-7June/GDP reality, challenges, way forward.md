- To achieve the **developed nation goal by 2047**, India needs sustained annual growth of around **8% or more**. Eg: The Economic Survey states that <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">consistent 8% growth is essential </mark>to meet infrastructure, employment, and welfare needs by 2047.
- India’s **population growth and development needs** demand faster economic expansion, regardless of how the rest of the world is performing. Eg: Even though India outpaces global peers, a <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">6.5% rate may not create enough jobs</mark> or uplift per capita incomes sufficiently.
- While 6.5% reflects **stability**,<mark style="background: FFFF2E;"> it also signals a plateau</mark>, with **low inflation but no signs of rapid acceleration** in the near future. Eg: Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran indicated India may not see major growth spurts soon, making it harder to catch up with long-term development targets.

## **true picture**

- A significant rise in **net taxes (taxes minus subsidies)** can inflate GDP figures without a corresponding increase in real economic activity.
- High net tax contributions may overshadow **sluggish performance in core sectors** like manufacturing or consumption, giving a misleading impression of overall health.
- While stable growth ensures **low inflation and reduced economic volatility**,<mark style="background: FFFF2E;"> it may not generate the momentum</mark> needed to transform India into a developed economy.
-  India’s growing population and developmental needs require **higher employment, infrastructure, and productivity**, which stable but slow growth may not adequately support.
- Relying on stable growth **without pushing for higher gains may lead to missed strategic opportunities.**

## **Way forward:**

- India must boost productivity by investing in **infrastructure, manufacturing, skilling, and digitalisation**, while simplifying regulations to attract both domestic and foreign investment.
- Policies should focus on **reviving rural consumption, supporting MSMEs, and expanding labour-intensive sectors** to ensure inclusive growth. Eg: Increasing public expenditure on health, education, and affordable housing can stimulate demand and generate employment.
