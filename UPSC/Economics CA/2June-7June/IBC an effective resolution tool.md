discussion about whether the **IBC is ready for the future**, whether its **decisions are respected**, and how **efficient the courts** are in handling cases

## **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) enacted in India in 2016**

- The IBC aimed to replace India’s **slow and fragmented insolvency system** with a **fast-track process** for resolving distressed assets within a maximum of <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**330 days**</mark> , ases like **Essar Steel** were resolved with **clear timelines**
- It empowered **creditors** by giving them control over the **insolvency process** and discouraging **willful default** - <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">Bhushan Steel case</mark> - creditors approved **Tata Steel’s resolution plan**, overriding **promoter control**
- IBC sought to improve **debt recovery rates** and create a culture of **responsible borrowing**
- As per **IBBI data**, creditors have recovered over **₹3.89 lakh crore**

### Preferred route
- According to the **RBI’s 2024 report**, the IBC accounted for <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**48% of all recoveries** made by banks in FY 2023-24</mark>
- **plans under IBC** are yielding **93.41% of the fair value** and **170.1% of liquidation value**
- Companies facing insolvency threats often **clear dues or settle quickly** - The IBC’s time-bound process has led to early settlements, with **30,310 cases settled before admission**

Credit culture
- The **Supreme Court** observed that “**the defaulter’s paradise is lost**
- The IBC has contributed to a sharp fall in **Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)**, which declined from <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**11.2% in 2018** to **2.8% in 2024</mark>
- A study by **IIM Bangalore** showed firms post-resolution had more professionalised management and **stronger compliance norms**.

### Challenges
- **Delays in approvals** by the **National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)** and prolonged litigation - **Jaypee Infratech** have been stuck for years
- **frequent challenges after plan approval** create **investor hesitation** - **Bhushan Power and Steel** case
- The IBC lacks **clear mechanisms** to deal with issues like **intellectual property valuation**, **employee dues**, and **tech continuity**

Way forward
- Expand the **capacity of NCLT and NCLAT** by appointing more judges
- Introduce **clear jurisprudential safeguards** to prevent post-resolution litigations and uphold the **sanctity of approved resolution plans** - boosting investors confidence
