thinking about changing the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act, 2010, and the Atomic Energy Act, 1962
**Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010,** deter foreign companies due to strict liability provisions. Amending them would enable global firms like **Westinghouse (U.S.)** and **Électricité de France (EDF)** to invest and supply nuclear technology.

- **Foreign Companies** - worry they’ll be held legally responsible if something goes wrong
- India’s current law makes the plant operator fully responsible, even if the equipment from foreign suppliers fails.
- In 2012, the **NDA opposed changes** in law that would reduce foreign companies

#### Benefits of amending
-  Legal clarity could attract funds and partnerships in **Small Modular Reactors**, helping scale capacity rapidly
- Companies like _L&T_ and _BHEL_ may contribute to infrastructure
- Amendments will **remove liability-related hurdles**, allowing global firms to invest

#### SMR ( Small modular reactors )
- produce up to **300 MW of electricity**
- built in factories for easy transport and quicker installation
- advanced, safer designs with features like **passive cooling and are ideal for remote areas, industrial use**

#### Challenges
- U.S. companies will share SMR tech **only if returns outweigh security or IP risks** - profit motive by foreign companies
- The **U.S. government** regulates tech transfers - IP Theft risk by big countries
- **Russia’s Rosatom** - Only allowed partial manufacturing in india - Kept control over ciritical hot components

**Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC)** is an **international treaty** - global fund to provide prompt compensation to **victims of nuclear accidents**
- assigns primary liability to nuclear plant operators while **limiting supplier liability**, ensuring faster **financial support and shared responsibility among participating countries.**
- CSC focuses on giving fast financial help to victims of **nuclear accidents** without long court cases
- all liability on nuclear operator, protecting suppliers - even if the product given by foreign company fails
- It sets up a multi-tiered fund (including global contributions) to support countries during large-scale accidents

#### Way forward

- Amend India’s nuclear laws to align liability rules with international standards like the CSC, ensuring fair responsibility
- Transparent policies to and incentives to encourage foreign companies in india enabling technology transfer parallelly developing indeginous nuclear technologies like small modular reactors, and building our own manufacturing and operational capabilites
