As the EU raises its own climate ambition, and as long as less stringent climate policies prevail in many non-EU countries, there is a risk of so-called ‘**carbon leakage**'.

companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production abroad to countries where less stringent climate policies are in place than in the EU, or when EU products get replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.

EU's tool to put a **fair price on the carbon emitted** during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU

ensure the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the carbon price of domestic production, and that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined

50 tonnes de minius is allowed for small importers, still 99% imports come under CBAM

#### CBAM definitive regime 2026

EU importers of goods covered by CBAM will register with national authorities where they can also buy **CBAM certificates.** The price of the certificates will be calculated depending on the **weekly average auction price of EU ETS allowances** expressed in €/tonne of CO2 emitted.

EU importers will **declare the emissions** embedded in their imports and **surrender** the corresponding number of certificates each year.

If importers can prove that a **carbon price has already been paid** during the production of the imported goods, the corresponding amount **can be deducted.**


Why this came up: The FTA signed between India UK **Excludes** the CBAM tariffs, increased the risk for Indian exporters 

#### CBAM transitional phase (2023 – 2025)

 **On 1 October 2023, the CBAM entered into application in its transitional phase, with the first reporting period for importers ending 31 January 2024.** The gradual phasing in of CBAM allows for a **careful, predictable and proportionate transition for EU and non-EU businesses**, as well as for public authorities.

The CBAM will **initially apply to imports of certain goods and selected precursors** whose production is carbon intensive and at most significant risk of carbon leakage: **cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen**


Impact on Indian exports
select indian goods may face 20-35 percent tariffs
