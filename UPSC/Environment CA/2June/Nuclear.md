thinking about changing the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act, 2010, and the Atomic Energy Act, 1962
**Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010,** deter foreign companies due to strict liability provisions. Amending them would enable global firms like **Westinghouse (U.S.)** and **Électricité de France (EDF)** to invest and supply nuclear technology.

- **Foreign Companies** - worry they’ll be held legally responsible if something goes wrong
- India’s current law makes the plant operator fully responsible, even if the equipment from foreign suppliers fails.
- In 2012, the **NDA opposed changes** in law that would reduce foreign companies

#### Benefits of amending
-  Legal clarity could attract funds and partnerships in **Small Modular Reactors**, helping scale capacity rapidly
- Companies like _L&T_ and _BHEL_ may contribute to infrastructure
- Amendments will **remove liability-related hurdles**, allowing global firms to invest

#### SMR
- produce up to **300 MW of electricity**
- built in factories for easy transport and quicker installation
