**Cold plates**, also known as direct-to-chip cooling, are small heat exchange modules equipped with microchannels to enhance heat transfer. Think of a cold plate like an ice pack strapped to a feverish forehead, but for computer chips. It sits directly on hot components, with small coolant-flled channels absorbing heat into tiny channels flled with coolant. When it becomes warmer, the coolant — such as 25% polyethylene glycol and 75% water — fows away and dumps the heat outside, while fresh coolant entering the veins keep the cycle going. This method is more efcient than fans the same way swapping a handheld fan for an ice-cold bath is better.

**immersion cooling**, is like dunking a hot frying pan into a pool of heat-hungry oil instead of blowing air on it. The oil, which is good at dissipating heat within itself, soaks up 100% of the pan’s heat and keeps it from overheating. In the one-phase cooling method, like swirling cold water around the pan, the oil stays liquid but carries heat away. In two-phase cooling, the technique works the way water cools in a mud pot: the coolant fuid bubbles into vapour at a low temperature, rises into a cooling coil, condenses, drips back down, and repeats.

## **using cold plates and immersion cooling in data centres

- These methods reduce emissions by **15–21%** compared to traditional air cooling.
- liquid coolants transfer heat more efficiently than air. _Eg:_ Alibaba’s deployment of cold plate cooling led to lower power usage effectiveness (PUE)
- Water usage drops by **31–52%**, helping conserve freshwater resources _Eg:_ In water-stressed regions like Arizona, using cold plate cooling helps tech firms operate data centres

## **life cycle assessment aid in evaluating cooling technologies**

The **Microsoft-WSP study** assessed **cold plates** and **immersion cooling** from production to end-of-life, revealing their **overall environmental benefits**.

**LCA** highlights **sustainability trade-offs**, helping compare the **true impact** of different **cooling methods**

**LCA** provides **data-driven insights** for **industry and policymakers** to adopt **greener technologies**

When combined with **cold plates** or **immersion cooling**, renewables amplify environmental benefits by further lowering **energy and water use**

**Liquid-cooling** systems like **cold plates** and **immersion cooling** transfer heat more efficiently than air, reducing the risk of overheating and improving hardware performance

## **Way forward:**

Governments should provide **tax breaks, capital subsidies, and faster approvals** for data centres that adopt **liquid-cooling systems** and **renewable energy integration**.

Introduce mandatory **Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)** and **carbon disclosure norms** for large-scale data centres to encourage **transparent, science-based decisions**
