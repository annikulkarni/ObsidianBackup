- India needs about **2,00,000 urban buses**, but currently has only **35,000**
- **Metros** are **expensive** and **slow to build**, with **lower-than-expected ridership**
- **India cannot afford large recurring subsidies**, and **private investment is low** due to **uncertain returns**. **Eg:** **E-bus projects in Pune** face delays

#### Investment in metro and e bus falling short 
- Metro projects involve **huge capital and operational costs**,
- People are **price-sensitive**, and **poor last-mile connectivity** discourages use of metros
- **E-buses** have **high replacement and maintenance costs**, without subsidies hard to sustain

#### Trams better (LOL)
- Trams show about **45% profitability** over their typical **70-year life cycle**
- Trams require **less frequent replacements** and have **lower running costs** compared to e-buses
- **scalable** in dense cities

#### GOI
- **PM e-Bus Sewa â€“ Payment Security Mechanism**: Aims to deploy and ensure reliable operations of **10,000 urban buses**, including electric ones. Cities like **Ahmedabad** are using

- **New Delhi** is using funds to order e-ambulances

Encourage **trams and trolleybuses** in high-density corridors through **life-cycle cost analysis**, while ensuring **targeted subsidies** for low-income commuters and investment in **green fuels** like bio-CNG and hydrogen.
