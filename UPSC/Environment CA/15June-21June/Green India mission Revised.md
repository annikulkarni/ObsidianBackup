- released by the Centre on June 17

#### Achievements since its launch 2014
- facilitated **tree plantation and afforestation** across **11.22 million hectares**
- Funds were allocated based on **ecological vulnerability and restoration potential**.
- **carbon sink** of **2.29 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent** between 2005–2021.
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Activities under GIM complement India’s **UNFCCC** goals on land restoration and carbon capture. - committment to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030</mark>
- Helped improve **livelihoods of forest-dependent communities** via sustainable forestry practices.
- Community plantation models in **Odisha** created jobs

#### Elements revised
- Focus on saturation-based, area-specific restoration in vulnerable landscapes like the Aravallis, <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Western Ghats, Himalayas, and mangroves.</mark>
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Aravalli Green Wall project</mark> - syncing
- **Aravalli protection**: Targeting 8 lakh hectares for forest, water system and grassland rejuvenation to curb sandstorm

#### Why 
- was made to **respond to changing climate conditions** and the increasing urgency of **land degradation and desertification**.
- The revised plan reflects **inputs from implementing states** and **scientific institutions**
- Special emphasis on **Himalayas, mangroves**, and degraded zones for **carbon sequestration**

Green wall project
- he **Centre** (Government of India) is spearheading the initiative, allocating funding and coordinating implementation across states.
- **three states (Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat)**, **one UT (Delhi)**  and guidance from the **Wildlife Institute of India (WII)**, using ecological data to target **12 degradation gaps** in the Aravalli range.

#### Addressing carbon sequestration, land degradation
- **restoring impaired open forests**, which is a **cost-effective and high-impact**
- Under the **Aravalli Green Wall Project**, **8 lakh hectares** will be restored to combat desertification
- As per the **Forest Survey of India (FSI)**, restoring **15 million hectares** can sequester **1.89 billion tonnes of CO₂**.
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">
- climate commitment to create an **additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes** of CO₂ by **2030**</mark>
-  <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">GIM aims to expand **forest and tree cover up to 24.7 million hectares**, capturing **3.39 billion tonnes of CO₂**.</mark>

- Adopt a **holistic, ecosystem-specific approach** by aligning GIM with other environmental programs (e.g., CAMPA, MGNREGS)
- Use **technology (GIS, remote sensing)** for real-time progress tracking, while empowering **local communities**
