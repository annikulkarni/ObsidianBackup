North Bengal’s tea gardens are in crisis, especially for women workers, due to climate change, pests, low wages

#### Challenges to women workers
- **headaches, vomiting, and exhaustion** while plucking leaves during peak summer
- Absence of crèches, sanitation, and rest shelters forces women to manage both labour and childcare
- Encroachment of wildlife into tea estates due to changing weather patterns, leopard attacks

#### Declining tea yield
- The monsoon is no longer evenly spread, with rainfall occurring in short, intense bursts,
- **30°C for extended periods** lead to loss of the tea’s aroma
- vulnerable to pests and diseases.

#### Worker woes
 - A worker earning only **Rs 250 per day**
 - With stagnant wages and no savings, workers remain stuck in poverty with **no chance to improve living standards**

#### Best practices
- going organic, reducing use of fertilizers improves soil health 
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">mulching and intercropping</mark> help retain moisture, reduce erosion
- Creation of water bodies and rainwater harvesting enhances water availability

#### Tea Sector overlooked in policy making
- lacks strong marketing and policy attention compared to other cash crops. eg: coffee has branding which tea lacks
- Tea is the **largest employer of women labourers**, yet there is inadequate investment eg : creche facilities
- Small growers lack access to funds and technical guidance to adopt climate-resilient practices.
