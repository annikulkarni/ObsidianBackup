**_International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation_** - 2025 (United Nations)
**_Decade of Action on Cryospheric Science (2025–2034)_**_._

#### World water day 
- **Theme:** _Glacier Preservation

#### Glacier 
- **preservation** ensures sustained **water availability** for **drinking, agriculture, and ecosystems**
- Glaciers are sensitive to **global warming**; their rapid **melting** signals **climate change impacts**.
- **Alpine glaciers** support **mountain agriculture** and **tourism**
####  **Source-to-Sea (S2S) approach**
- S2S treats **freshwater and marine systems as a connected continuum** Eg: **Ganges** directly affects the health of the **Bay of Bengal**
- **cooperation among multiple stakeholders and political jurisdictions**, Eg:**Manila Declaration ****ridge-to-reef** management to protect water quality
- S2S enables holistic strategies that tackle issues like **pollution, water diversion, and habitat loss**

## **cryosphere**

The cryosphere includes all frozen water parts of Earth. It helps regulate the climate, reflects sunlight, and stores Earth’s freshwater.

#### Changing mountain cryosphere

- Reduced glacial melt in the **Himalayas** affects the flow of rivers like the **Ganges**, impacting water availability for millions.
- Their retreat means **less buffering capacity during dry periods**
- glacier size in the **Alps** affects water supplies for European river
