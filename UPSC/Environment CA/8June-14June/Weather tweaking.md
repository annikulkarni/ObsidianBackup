- A **recent study** in the journal _Earth’s Future_ shared a **new idea** that could make **SAI cheaper and easier to use**
#### New idea
- the study **proposes modifying existing aircraft (like the Boeing 777F)** to spray aerosols at lower altitudes.
- The study suggests carrying out aerosol injections at **lower altitudes** (around 13 km) in **polar and extratropical regions**, where the stratosphere is more easily reachable

#### **What is Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)?**

**SAI** is a proposed method of **cooling the planet** by injecting **tiny reflective particles (aerosols)** into the **stratosphere**. It is inspired by **volcanic eruptions**, which naturally cool the Earth by spewing particles that reflect sunlight. These aerosols reduce the **amount of sunlight** reaching the Earth’s surface, creating a **cooling effect**.

#### Why 
- Aerosols (like sulphur dioxide) reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space, reducing the heat reaching Earth’s surface. Ex: 1991 <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Mount Pinatubo</mark> eruption released sulphur dioxide, cooling Earth by about **0.5°C** for over a year.
- SAI can lower atmospheric temperatures temporarily, helping to reduce severe climate effects like **heatwaves, ice melt, and sea-level rise**. eg: **12 million tonnes** of sulphur dioxide at <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">13 km altitude could cool the planet by **0.6°C**.</mark>
- could provide a **temporary buffer** against extreme climate impacts - delay crop failure, habitat loss

#### low altitude SAI
- Low-altitude SAI can be conducted using **existing aircraft** - Standard jets like the **Boeing 777F** can reach stratospheric levels in polar regions
- reduces **technical complexity**, such as extreme temperature and pressure challenges
- It enables **quicker deployment**, avoiding the **10-year delay**
- **Polar and Extratropical Regions** - **stratosphere starts at lower altitudes**, making it accessible
- equatorial regions - stratosphere begins at **18 km or higher**
- SAI to be conducted with **less cost and effort**


#### challenges
- SAI could lead to **acid rain**, **delayed ozone recovery**, and unknown ecological disruptions - can **form sulphuric acid** in the atmosphere
- Cooling could be **stronger in polar regions**, while **tropical areas** face the worst climate impacts - may not get benefitted equally
- SAI affects the **entire planet**, raising questions about **who decides** when, where, and how it’s used

#### forward
- International collaboration is essential to regulate research, testing, and potential deployment of SAI
- SAI should be treated as a **temporary, supplementary tool** - not a replacement for emission reduction.
