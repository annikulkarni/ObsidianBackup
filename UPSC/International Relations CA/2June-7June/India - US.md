#### Subsea cable

**_Subsea cables_**_, which carry over_ **_95% of international data_** _and form the_ **_backbone_** _of_ **_global internet infrastructure_**_, are being recognized for their critical_ **_geostrategic value_**_._

_Efforts are being made by_ **_India_** _to_ **_diversify_** _its_ **_digital infrastructure_** _under the proposed_ <mark style="background: FFFF2E;">**_TRUST framework</mark>_** _(Technology for Resilient, Open and Unified Security and Trust)._



## **Why are Subsea Cables crucial**

- Subsea cables carry **over 95% of international data traffic**, forming the **physical backbone** of the internet and digital economy. Securing these is vital for protecting **critical infrastructure**
- China’s **Digital Silk Road** is rapidly laying subsea cables across the Indo-Pacific, posing **geopolitical and cybersecurity concerns**.Eg: The upcoming India-U.S. trade agreement includes provisions for enhancing digital infrastructure as a counter to China’s presence in the Indo-Pacific.
- Joint efforts in building resilient cable systems support **broader technology cooperation** and **secure trade flows**


##  **TRUST framework**

- The **TRUST (Technology for Resilient, Open and Unified Security and Trust)** framework aims to build trusted digital ecosystems by reducing dependence on untrusted vendors and creating **secure, interoperable technology supply chains**.
- The framework acknowledges India’s potential as a **net security provider** in the Indo-Pacific, aligning with U.S. efforts to **de-risk strategic technologies** and build **redundancy in digital connectivity**.
- TRUST enables **concessional finance**, cybersecurity assistance, and encourages **American companies** to anchor digital infrastructure projects in India and the region. **Eg:** Under TRUST, Meta’s multi-year undersea cable investment project aligns with **U.S.-India strategic digital cooperation**.
## **Regional hub for subsea connectivity**

- India is centrally positioned between Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia, near key maritime choke points like the <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, and Bab-el-Mandeb</mark>, making it ideal for **global cable routes**. **Eg:** India can serve as a **transit junction** for Africa-Asia and Europe-Asia subsea cables.
- increase the number of landing stations beyond existing clusters to **reduce regional risk**

## Challenges

- Deploying subsea cables in India requires <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">navigating a maze of over **50 clearances**</mark> across multiple **ministries** Eg: **customs**, **naval authorities**, and **telecom departments
- **Overconcentration of** **_Landing Stations_** 15 of 17 subsea cables land in **Mumbai**, despite India’s **11,098 km coastline**
- India depends on **foreign-flagged ships** for cable repairs, which take **3–5 months** to respond due to long travel times and **clearance delays**

## **Way forward:**
Simplify and streamline the complex licensing and clearance processes to attract greater investments
Develop Indian-flagged cable repair vessels and expand cable landing stations

### Trump’s tariffs and US - India trade agreement
- U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing that the President **exceeded legal authority** by imposing tariffs without Congressional approval.
- sweeping tariffs bypassed legislative and judicial checks, **undermining the constitutional framework**, it must involve congress, not unilateral executive orders
- he court ruled that invoking a “national emergency” does not justify rewriting international tariff agreements.

#### why the court rejected
- The court ruled that there was no **statutory authority** for the **President**
- **national emergency powers** cannot allow the **President** to override **trade laws**
- no credible evidence of an **immediate or actual threat** that would justify **emergency trade measures**.
- administration failed to account for **services** and **arms trade** while citing **trade deficits** as justification.
- U.S. cited a **$44.4 billion deficit** with **India**, while it actually runs a **$35–40 billion surplus** when services are included.
- contradicted **U.S. commitments under WTO agreements** and eroded **global trade norms**, Eg: **tariffs** even to **uninhabited territories** like the **Heard and McDonald Islands**

#### Justification by US
- Despite WTO panels rejecting the **justification** in 2022, the U.S. raised **steel and aluminium tariffs** to **50%** on India.
- enhanced **tariffs** served as **negotiation tools** to pressure trade partners eg: US claimed that tariffs helped them to negotiate trade deal with india
- The **50% tariffs** imposed in 2025 contradicted the **earlier settlement**, undermining trust in **WTO dispute resolution**.
