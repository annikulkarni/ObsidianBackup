### Trump’s tariffs and US - India trade agreement
- U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing that the President **exceeded legal authority** by imposing tariffs without Congressional approval.
- sweeping tariffs bypassed legislative and judicial checks, **undermining the constitutional framework**, it must involve congress, not unilateral executive orders
- he court ruled that invoking a “national emergency” does not justify rewriting international tariff agreements.

#### why the court rejected
- The court ruled that there was no **statutory authority** for the **President**
- **national emergency powers** cannot allow the **President** to override **trade laws**
- no credible evidence of an **immediate or actual threat** that would justify **emergency trade measures**.
- administration failed to account for **services** and **arms trade** while citing **trade deficits** as justification.
- U.S. cited a **$44.4 billion deficit** with **India**, while it actually runs a **$35–40 billion surplus** when services are included.
- contradicted **U.S. commitments under WTO agreements** and eroded **global trade norms**, Eg: **tariffs** even to **uninhabited territories** like the **Heard and McDonald Islands**

#### Justification by US
- Despite WTO panels rejecting the **justification** in 2022, the U.S. raised **steel and aluminium tariffs** to **50%** on India.
- enhanced **tariffs** served as **negotiation tools** to pressure trade partners eg: US claimed that tariffs helped them to negotiate trade deal with india
- The **50% tariffs** imposed in 2025 contradicted the **earlier settlement**, undermining trust in **WTO dispute resolution**.

#### Addressing issues
- India must ensure that the **U.S. removes punitive tariffs** on Indian exports like **steel and aluminium**
- India should seek guarantees that its **digital services taxes** will not face **retaliation**
- negotiate exemption from the proposed **3.5% tax on remittances** under the **Trump One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB)**
- India must address growing **restrictions and backlash** against **H-1B visas**

India should negotiate a **comprehensive trade deal** that protects its **strategic sectors**, ensures **reciprocity**, and strengthens **economic resilience**
