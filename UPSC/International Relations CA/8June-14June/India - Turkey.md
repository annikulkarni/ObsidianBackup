- Got involved in Syria, Libya, Caucaus to show support and expand influence protecting islamic groups
- Still is a NATO member, maintains military relations with the west
- blends **ideological objectives** with **pragmatic diplomacy** to gain leverage in regional and global affairs.

#### Why it has blended both islamic ideology with pro western alliances

- Expand influence in both worlds, It supported the **Muslim Brotherhood** in **Egypt** while remaining a **NATO member** and hosting **U.S. nuclear weapons**at **Incirlik Airbase**.
- Türkiye positions itself as a **key regional power** using **diplomatic flexibility**, supplied drones to Ukraine, refused to impose sanctions on russia, got s400
- he also pursued **EU accession negotiations** and maintained **U.S. relations**.
- Türkiye supported **HTS in Syria**, deployed **troops in Qatar**, and backed **Azerbaijan against Armenia** - aiming to revive past ottoman islamic glory

#### <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**Türkiye’s involvement in Syria, Libya, and the Caucasus expanded its regional influence?**</mark>
- Türkiye backed **anti-Assad factions**, including the **Free Syrian Army** and later **Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)**, to expand its presence near the **Israeli border** and counter **Kurdish militias**. Eg: Türkiye created a **buffer zone** on the **Turkish-Syrian border** and opposed military operations against **HTS**, enhancing its influence in northern Syria.
- supported the **Tripoli-based government**, which was dominated by **Islamist groups**, against the **eastern faction** supported by Egypt and Russia - Its intervention shifted powers in Libya, expanding influence in north africa
- Türkiye supported **Azerbaijan**militarily and diplomatically against **Russia-backed Armenia** - **drones and training** helped Azerbaijan gain territory in **Nagorno-Karabakh**
- enhances its **bargaining power** with both the **West** and **Russia**, giving it room to extract **concessions** - Eg: Despite tensions over S-400, Türkiye supported **Sweden and Finland’s NATO entry**, using its strategic role to influence **Western policy** decisions.

#### Ethical Issues 
- Backing groups like **Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)** ( <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">Al Qaeda Roots</mark> ), which has links to terrorist networks, raises serious ethical concerns
- Türkiye’s military involvement in conflict zones (Syria, Libya, Caucasus) can lead to **civilian casualties** and **human rights violations**

#### Impact on India
- Its support to pakistan, undermine India's diplomatic interests eg: Türkiye backed **Islamabad**, which may influence **international forums** like the **UN** or **OIC** against India.
- Its champion of muslims foregin policy might be a counter to india's engagment with gulf countries, its support to kashmir at OIC can affect India's relations with the Muslims majority countries
- engagement in **South Asia** and **Central Asia** through military and diplomatic ties (e.g., with **Azerbaijan** and **Pakistan**) may reduce India’s **strategic space** in the extended neighbourhood. eg: Turkiye's participation in military drills in pakistan 

#### Way forward
- India should **deepen ties with countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, and Central Asian republics** to counterbalance Türkiye’s growing regional influence
- Eg: Expanding the **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)** and increasing **energy and security cooperation** with Gulf nations can help secure India’s interests.
- India must actively engage in **multilateral platforms** (like OIC, UN, SCO) to **neutralize anti-India rhetoric** and promote a **moderate, inclusive image**. Eg: Leveraging its **civilizational diplomacy and diaspora** to reinforce its role as a responsible power in the Islamic world.
