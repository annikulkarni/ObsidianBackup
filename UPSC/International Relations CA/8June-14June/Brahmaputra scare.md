China building dams upstream on the Brahmaputra River - 60,000 MW Medog Hydropower Project in Tibet.
![[Pasted image 20250608144749.png]]

- **34.2% of the Brahmaputra basin area** (in india) - contributes over **80% of the river’s total water flow**
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">average annual rainfall of **2,371 mm**</mark>
- gives India better scope to design **flood control infrastructure** and **storage systems**
- India is developing hydropower projects like **Dibang 2880W and Subansiri 2000W** in Arunachal Pradesh based on its flow share.

**Note:** A **“riparian state”** refers to a state or country that shares a river or stream border with another state or country.

#### Medong Hydropower (Tibet) 
- 60000MW, cost of $137 billion, significant environmental, geopolitical, and social implications for the region
- could allow **manipulation** of the **Brahmaputra’s flow** - risk of artificial floods
- The dam’s location in a **seismic zone** threatens **biodiversity**, landslide risk, sediment concentration
- No formal pact exist between India and china regarding this - <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">trust deficits</mark>

What india is doing 
- The proposed **Upper Siang project** aims to store floodwaters and generate electricity - support irrigation drinking
- Brahmaputra key navigable waterway under India’s Act East Policy Eg: **National Waterway-2 (NW-2)** on the Brahmaputra facilitates

#### way forward
- Initiate dialogue - formal transboundary water sharing agreement, ensuring transparency
- Promote joint environmental impact assessment(EIA), involving china, BD, India under a multilateral platform like UN, SAARC
