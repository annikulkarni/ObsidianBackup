Muhammad Yunus delays elections to April 2026 and proposes the “July Proclamation” <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">to reform or replace the 1972 Constitution.</mark>
- pushed by an **unelected interim regime** without a **popular mandate** or proper **parliamentary debate**.
- move seeks to **marginalize** the **legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman** and diminish the significance of **December (Victory Day)** and **August (Mujib’s assassination)**, promoting **July** as a new political start.

Leading to authoritarianism?
- Such reforms can be used to **prolong the tenure** of the interim regime, sideline opposition, and **weaken checks and balances**
- Constitutional changes without **bipartisan consensus** can lead to **unrest**, **legitimacy crises**, and **deep political divisions**. The BNP though against the Awami league is unconfortable with the proposed reforms


#### **proposed humanitarian corridor affect regional security**
- A **demilitarised humanitarian corridor**, especially if monitored by **international forces**, may be seen as a **breach of national sovereignty**
- The **Bangladesh Army chief** objected to international enforcement in the Rakhine region, fearing it would **undermine Bangladesh’s sovereignty**
- could be exploited by **international armed groups** to **smuggle weapons** and infiltrate conflict zones.
- no guarantee that **humanitarian aid** will reach only the intended civilian population (like **Rohingya**) and not be diverted to **militant factions**


- **Exclusion of major political parties** weakens democratic legitimacy
