**“Rising Lion” operation** against Iran
#### Strategic objectives
- dismantle Iran’s ability to develop or deploy nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
- High-ranking officials like the **Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces** and **Revolutionary Guard commanders**were assassinated.
- campaign follows **21 months of pressure** on Iran and its proxies, including **provocative assassinations**

#### concerns
- The **Sunni Arab world** fears **blowback** through attacks on oil facilities, incitement of **Shia minorities**
- chokepoints like the **Strait of Hormuz** can disrupt global energy flows. **Eg**: About **20% of global oil**

#### US foreign policy 
- The U.S. pulled out of the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)** in 2018
- the U.S. exited the deal and applied **“maximum pressure” sanctions**
- U.S. actions aimed to weaken Iran economically and diplomatically, increasing regional hostility.
- The U.S. pressured **Saudi Arabia** to **flood the oil market**, reducing Iran’s **oil revenues**
- The **June 12 IAEA resolution**, U.S. **airstrikes on al-Houthis**, and **renewed ties with Pakistan** signal coordinated steps

#### Implications of the conflict with sunni arab world
- The conflict raises the risk of disruption in the **Strait of Hormuz**,
- **incite Shia minorities** in Sunni-ruled countries
- Iran-backed **militias or proxies** may target Sunni governments eg: **Hezbollah**, **Houthis**, or **Iraqi militias** could threaten infrastructure in **UAE** or **Saudi Arabia**.
- Countries like **Saudi Arabia** and the **UAE** are wary of openly backing Israel, fearing **retaliation and regional backlash**.
- Oil price surge, inflation, hurting import dependent countries

#### Impact on india
- A spike in brent crude prices would increase India’s **current account deficit**, raise fuel prices, and trigger **inflation**.
- **delicate diplomatic balance** between Israel, Iran, and the U.S. eg: India has strategic ties with israel (defence, tech) and also energy and connectivity ties with Iran, Chabahar port, 
- Escalation could impact the safety of the **Indian diaspora** in the Gulf and disrupt **maritime trade** routes.

#### Way forward
- should diversify oil import sources (e.g., from Latin America, Africa) and **expand strategic petroleum reserves**
- deals with Brazil, UAE, and the U.S., while increasing domestic oil storage capacity.
- India must engage in **quiet diplomacy** with both Israel and Iran, reaffirming strategic ties without compromising neutrality. using platforms like G20, SCO, BRICS need to promote regional de escalation


# What is Netanyahu’s endgame in Iran
Israel controls the skies and keeps bombing Iran to stop its nuclear program

- Israel aimed to destroy key facilities involved in uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel processing. **Eg:** The air strikes on **Natanz** and **Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre** targeted centrifuge halls, uranium conversion labs, and fuel manufacturing plants.
- weaken Iran’s retaliatory capabilities by decapitating its chain of command
- came 3days just before scheduled U.S.-Iran 6th nuclear talks

- The **Natanz facility’s** above-ground buildings were “completely destroyed”, but the **underground centrifuge hall** remained mostly intact, as per the **IAEA**.
- Several critical facilities were hit, At **Isfahan**, Israel destroyed a **chemical lab**, **uranium conversion plant**, **fuel manufacturing plant**
- Iran launched **~400 missiles**, striking targets in Israel like the **Haifa oil refinery**

#### Regional security 
- Hezbollah in lebanon, Shia militants in Iraq and syria could retalitate, may escalate beyond israel and iran
- derails ongoing peace talks and normalisation efforts between Israel and Arab nations
- ran may target Gulf oil infrastructure or tankers, affecting exports from **Saudi Arabia**, **Kuwait**, and **UAE**

#### US role
- the U.S. has tacitly approved Israel’s actions, trump opposed on social media
- Netanyahu admitted they have attacked with clear green light of USA
- **Iran has been cautious** to avoid direct conflict with U.S. forces
#### Future
- Israel can continue bombing, but it doesnt have the capabilities to completely destroy Iran's nuclear capabilites
- It can pause attacks to allow negotiations between US and Iran, US use attacks to force Iran to a deal 
- **Eg:** Iran reportedly sent **feelers through Gulf countries** expressing willingness to talk if Israel stops bombing

#### way forward
- _Global powers, especially the_ **_U.S._**_,_ **_EU_**_, and_ **_UN_**_, should mediate a_ **_ceasefire_** _to de-escalate hostilities and revive_ **_nuclear diplomacy_**
- _Establish a joint_ **_crisis response framework_** _involving_ **_regional actors_** _(like_ **_Saudi Arabia_**_,_ **_UAE_**_, and_ **_Turkey_**_) to contain_ **_proxy escalations_** _and protect_ **_civilian infrastructure_**_._
