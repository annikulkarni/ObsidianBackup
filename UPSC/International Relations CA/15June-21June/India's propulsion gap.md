#### why has India failed to develop a jet engine
- **high thrust-to-weight ratios**, **thermal stability**, and **advanced metallurgy**
- **Kaveri GTX-35VS** engine under development since **1989**, failed to meet **performance benchmarks** 
- lacks access to **critical technologies** like **single-crystal turbine blades**, **thermal barrier coatings**, and **advanced cooling systems**
- Negotiations with GE F414 have hit a road block because GE refused to transfer full technology
- Lack of long term funding, Over 2000 crore has been spent on kaveri engine
- **foreign suppliers** has created a **complacency** in indigenous R&D

#### HF-24 Marut _Spirit of the Tempest”_
- Designed by well known German WW2 defence designer Kurt Tank, manufactured by HAL
- equipped with **British Bristol Siddeley Orpheus 703 turbojets**
- lacked thrust, India could not **procure or co-develop** a more suitable engine to enhance the Marut’s performance
- limited by its **propulsion shortfall**
- **engine limitation** was the Marut’s **Achilles’ heel**

#### Import dependency 
- Delivery of 99 General Electric F404 engines for the **LCA Mk1A** was delayed by **13 months**
- core technologies like **single-crystal turbine blades** restricts India’s ability to upgrade
- **foreign engines requires third-party approvals**

GOI
- joint ventures and international collaborations to acquire **advanced propulsion technology**. ex : HAL signed a deal with **General Electric** to **co-produce GE F414 engines**
- The **Kaveri engine project** was decoupled from the LCA program and is being explored for use in **UAVs and future aircraft**
- Several **defence PSUs and private players** have been incentivized to develop **components and sub-systems** - atmanirbhar bharat

#### way forward
- acquire technologies like single crystal turbine, and thermal barrier coating through joint ventures, know how of GE-HAL engine co development
- connecting **DRDO**, **GTRE**, **academia**, and **private industry** to focus on **advanced propulsion R&D** with **long-term investment**.
- **private sector participation** in defence through the **Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX)**

#### headlines of new project

- ₹15,000 crore allocated for the development of the AMCA, India's fifth-generation stealth multirole fighter jet[4](https://economictimes.com/news/new-updates/hal-amca-what-is-indias-fifth-generation-fighter-jet-and-how-does-it-compare-with-f-35-su-57-j-20/articleshow/121457030.cms).
    
- AMCA is a twin-engine, 25-tonne aircraft with a maximum speed of Mach 2.15 and a combat range of 1,620 km[2](https://compass.rauias.com/current-affairs/advanced-medium-combat-aircraft-indias-fifth-generation-fighter-jet/)[7](https://www.defencexp.com/understanding-the-amca-programme-part-2/).
    
- It features advanced stealth technologies including internal weapons bays, serpentine air intakes, and radar-absorbing materials to reduce radar and infrared signatures[2](https://compass.rauias.com/current-affairs/advanced-medium-combat-aircraft-indias-fifth-generation-fighter-jet/)6[7](https://www.defencexp.com/understanding-the-amca-programme-part-2/).
    
- The aircraft will carry up to 6,500 kg of weapons externally and 1,500 kg internally in stealth mode, including air-to-air missiles and precision-guided munitions[2](https://compass.rauias.com/current-affairs/advanced-medium-combat-aircraft-indias-fifth-generation-fighter-jet/)[5](https://alchetron.com/HAL-AMCA)6.
    
- Initial prototypes will use GE414 engines, with plans for an indigenous engine producing around 110 kN thrust in production variants[3](https://pwonlyias.com/current-affairs/advanced-medium-combat-aircraft-amca/)[7](https://www.defencexp.com/understanding-the-amca-programme-part-2/).
