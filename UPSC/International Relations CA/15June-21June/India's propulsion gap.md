#### why has India failed to develop a jet engine
- **high thrust-to-weight ratios**, **thermal stability**, and **advanced metallurgy**
- **Kaveri GTX-35VS** engine under development since **1989**, failed to meet **performance benchmarks** 
- lacks access to **critical technologies** like **single-crystal turbine blades**, **thermal barrier coatings**, and **advanced cooling systems**
- Negotiations with GE F414 have hit a road block because GE refused to transfer full technology
- Lack of long term funding, Over 2000 crore has been spent on kaveri engine
- **foreign suppliers** has created a **complacency** in indigenous R&D

#### HF-24 Marut _Spirit of the Tempest”_
- Designed by well known German WW2 defence designer Kurt Tank, manufactured by HAL
- equipped with **British Bristol Siddeley Orpheus 703 turbojets**
- lacked thrust, India could not **procure or co-develop** a more suitable engine to enhance the Marut’s performance
- limited by its **propulsion shortfall**
- **engine limitation** was the Marut’s **Achilles’ heel**

#### Import dependency 
- Delivery of 99 General Electric F404 engines for the **LCA Mk1A** was delayed by **13 months**
- core technologies like **single-crystal turbine blades** restricts India’s ability to upgrade
- **foreign engines requires third-party approvals**

GOI
- joint ventures and international collaborations to acquire **advanced propulsion technology**. ex : HAL signed a deal with **General Electric** to **co-produce GE F414 engines**
