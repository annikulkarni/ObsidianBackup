India recently withdrew Bangladesh’s access to its ports for sending goods to other countries
- India cited **logistical constraints** and **congestion at its ports**
- seen in Dhaka as a **political signal**, possibly linked to **Bangladesh’s growing ties with China**
- aimed to **discourage strategic balancing** by Bangladesh, especially as Dhaka has been **reopening maritime trade with Pakistan**

Impact
- withdrawal of the transshipment facility has **reintroduced political conditionality** into what was seen as **neutral trade infrastructure**, weakening trust in regional integration efforts.
- BD Need to find costlier alternatives ports/routes for its ready made garments exports
- Other BIMSTEC members (like **Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar**) may now view Indian trade infrastructure as **subject to political shifts**

Politicising trade affecting credibility 
- Revoking the transshipment facility with **Bangladesh** due to geopolitical tensions contradicts India’s projected role as a **neutral integrator**
- May push the members to see alternatives to hedge against over dependence on india
- The credibility of a future **BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement** could suffer if member states believe India might alter terms **based on bilateral tensions**.

Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser referring to the country as the **“maritime lifeline”** for India’s Northeast indirectly challenges India’s **Act East and Sagarmala initiatives**.

deeper Bangladesh-China economic ties may fragment the regional architecture that India is promoting through BIMSTEC.

Way forward
- India should establish transparent, rules-based mechanisms for port access and transshipment to avoid ad-hoc or politically motivated decisions.
- Projects like the **India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway** can be expanded under a **BIMSTEC umbrella**ndia must draw a firm line between diplomatic disputes and regional trade policies to preserve trust and reliability.
