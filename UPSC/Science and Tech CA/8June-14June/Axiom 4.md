- Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s trip to the International Space Station (ISS)
- India's participation is strategic aligning with India's future missions such as gaganyaan, 1984 Rakesh Sharma's participation was just symbolic
- ISRO is now a global leader in satellite and rocket technology and aims to have a space station by 2035, back then India didnt not have well developed space infrastructure
- Provides real life experience and technical inputs

#### Why important 
- As **designated pilot**, he will operate systems, respond to contingencies, and interact with international crew — skills critical for Gaganyaan’s success.
- will help ISRO refine **life-support systems, re-entry safety measures, and astronaut training** for Gaganyaan.
-  Axiom-4 allows ISRO to test custom-designed biological and technological experiments - Eg : **Muscle degradation studies and moong dal growth**
- knowledge resource for other Gaganyaan astronauts, an train upcoming Indian astronauts
- Shukla’s ISS stay gives ISRO insights into **modular space living, docking operations, international coordination**

#### Align with India's research
- **muscle behaviour studies** in zero gravity help understand **health impacts of space travel**.
- Studies on **sprouting moong dal** and **micro-algae** explore **sustainable food solutions** in space.
- Experiments are **customised to Indian needs**,marking ISRO’s entry into **tailor-made space research**.
