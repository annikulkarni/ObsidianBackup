Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials has introduced a new method to extract nickel
#### Hydrogen plasma method
- Hydrogen gas is converted into plasma using an **electric arc furnace**. This plasma reacts with nickel oxide to produce **pure nickel** and **water**, instead of carbon dioxide.
- partially effective for laterite ores eg : Odisha's Sukinda belt

##### Traditional Method
- 4 Step process
	- calcination
	- smelting
	- reduction 
	- refining
- Releases CO2
##### New method
- Using hydrogen plasma
- Emits 82% lower co2
- Water as by product

#### Why Nickel is important
- High-nickel batteries like NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) offer higher energy density and longer life for EVs
- Over 60% of global nickel is used in making **stainless steel**
- aerospace, defence, electronics Eg : Jet engines, turbines
- Essential is manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, grid scale batteries, pushing towards greener economy

#### Where in India
- Found as **nickeliferous limonite** in chromite mine overburden with 0.4–0.9% nickel content. - Odisha Sukinda Valley, 
- Jharkhand , Singhbhum ( less quantity )

#### GOI
- **National Critical Mineral Mission**: Launched in **January 2025** with **₹16,300–34,300 crore outlay** to enhance **domestic exploration**, **mining**, **processing**, and **recycling** of minerals like **nickel**, **lithium**, and **cobalt**.
- **PLI scheme** for **Advanced Chemistry Cell batteries**
-  **Mineral Security Partnership** and **Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL)** - securing overseas mineral assets
