7June - World food safety day 
Theme - _Food Safety: Science in Action_

#### India's approaches
- **Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954** - whether food was adulterated or not
-  **Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006** - **scientific, risk-based approach** through the creation of **FSSAI**.
- adopting global norms - **Codex Alimentarius Commission** Eg: **Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs)** and **Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)** defined
- focusing on generating its own **toxicological data** and conducting **Total Diet Studies (TDS)** to suit local needs. - considering Indian specific dietary patterns and environmental factors

#### Toxicology studies
- **scientific assessments** that evaluate the **harmful effects of chemicals or substances**
	 Why required for India specific
	- Different dietary patterns of Indians
	- Farming methods and pesticide use are different - tailor safety limits
	- Climate, water quality and genetic factors impact health, Heavy metal contamination
	- 
Monosodium glumtamate (MSG)
- Enhance **umami** taste (a savoury flavour)
- sodium salt of glutamic acid
- Joint Expert committee on food additives have declared MSG safe, but India labels them as unsafe for infants
- This is misleading, as **natural glutamates** (chemically identical to MSG) are found in **tomato, mushroom, garlic**, and even **breast milk**.
- MSG receiving an **“ADI not specified”** status globally (indicating high safety) - India soap slow

#### Better communication
- Communicate complex terms like **MRLs** (Maximum Residue Limits) and **ADIs** (Acceptable Daily Intake) in **easy-to-understand formats** Eg: explain it as a level safe for life long consumption
- Replace misleading labels Eg : MSG
- Build public trust through open communication

#### forward
- Conduct **localized toxicological studies** and **Total Diet Studies** - reflect local dietary habits and farming practices
- Simplify scientific terms for the public, **revise outdated labels**, and build **transparent engagement** with stakeholders
