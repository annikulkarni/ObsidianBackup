India’s cities will host over 800 million people by 2050
still lack gender balance

- 46% representation in local bodies (MOP)
- <mark class="hltr-red">only **20% of IAS officers** are women</mark>
- Only 11.7% of India’s police force are women (BPRD, 2023), non-field, clerical roles.
- there are **no parallel affirmative policies** in bureaucracy for women.

#### Gender responsive budgeting (GRB)
- ensures that urban budgets reflect the different needs of women, men, and marginalised groups.**Eg**: Delhi used GRB to fund **women-only buses** and **public lighting**, improving women’s mobility and safety in public spaces.
- while neglecting community toilets, crèches, or footpaths that benefit women, may overinvest in other sectors
- encourages civic engagement by linking public spending to **gender equity outcomes**., Kerala’s **People’s Plan Campaign**

#### Gender gap
- In Delhi and Mumbai, **84% of women use public or shared transport**.
- sanitation, maternal health, or childcare are underprioritised, male led departments
- female administrators are more responsive to grassroots needs - Studies by ICRIER and UN Women

Global examples
- **Philippines** mandates that **5% of local budgets** be allocated to gender programmes, U**ganda** requires **gender equity certificates** before fund approvals.
- **South Korea** uses **gender impact assessments** to redesign public transport and urban spaces,

GOI
- The **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments** mandate **33% reservation for women**
- introduced the **Gender Budget Statement** in **2005-06**
- <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">**Delhi** funds women-only buses and street lighting; **Tamil Nadu** applies GRB across 64 departments; **Kerala** links gender goals to the **People’s Plan Campaign**.</mark>
- **Kudumbashree** in Kerala for grassroots women-led governance.
- Mandate **gender audits**, **participatory budgeting**, and **monitoring frameworks** across all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
