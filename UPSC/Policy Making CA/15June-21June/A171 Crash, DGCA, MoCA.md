shocking reminder of how poor aviation safety is in India

- DGCA and MoCA failed to enforce basic safety measures, such as proper runway maintenance and bird hazard management
-  Overgrown grass near the runway in Ahmedabad attracted birds, possibly causing engine failure
- Eg: After major crashes like Mangaluru (2010) and Kozhikode (2020) systemic safety norms ignored 
- headed by bereaucracts lack technical expertise in aviation safety 

#### lack of accountability 
- scapegoating pilots, not addressing deeper regulatory and infrastructural issues
- **named the pilots publicly**, violating **ICAO norms**
- After **Mangaluru crash**, a **PIL listing DGCA and MoCA violations** was dismissed

#### What was violated 
- The **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)** mandates that crew identities be protected during and after investigations
- in the current incident breaching **ICAO Annex 13**
- **strict runway maintenance**, especially before seasonal weather shifts, to prevent bird strikes and foreign object damage.

#### Way forward
- Enforce strict compliance with **ICAO safety protocols**, such as restricting construction near flight paths and maintaining airport surroundings.
- Create an **autonomous investigation body** separate from the Ministry of Civil Aviation
- The U.S. **NTSB** operates independently of the FAA
