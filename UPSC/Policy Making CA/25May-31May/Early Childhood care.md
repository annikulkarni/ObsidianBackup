<mark class="hltr-boom-bam">The Heckman Curve</mark> <mark class="hltr-boom-bam">shows that investments in ECE yield the **greatest returns compared to later stages**</mark> of education or training. _Eg:_ For every $1 spent on ECE, the return ranges between **$7 to $12**, through better education, health, and reduced crime.

Quality ECE leads to **higher lifetime earnings, better employment, and improved life outcomes**, helping individuals and economies thrive.

ECE helps close learning gaps caused by poverty, ensuring **children enter school prepared**, reducing dropouts and remedial education costs. _Eg:_ States like Odisha are launching **Shishu Vatikas** to prepare 5–6-year-olds for formal schooling, improving readiness and future learning outcomes.
