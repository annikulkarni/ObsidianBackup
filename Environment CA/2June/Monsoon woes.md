The **Northeast** has a complex **topography** of **steep hills** and **fast-flowing rivers** like the **Brahmaputra** and **Barak**.
These rivers often **overflow** during monsoon, causing **floods** and **erosion**. Eg: In **Assam**, over **10 major rivers** flowed above **danger level** in June 2025, affecting over **3 lakh people** across **19 districts**.
The region receives one of the **highest average monsoon rainfalls** in India, making even a **“below normal” monsoon**destructive.

The region experiences both the **southwest monsoon** (**June–September**) and a **retreating monsoon** (**October–December**), increasing **disaster exposure**. The **fragile ecology**, including **deforestation** and **slope instability**, worsens risks. Eg: In **North Sikkim**, **landslides** in early **June 2025** marooned **1,500 tourists** and **blocked arterial roads** due to **incessant rain**.

## **Dual Monsoon Pattern**

**Dual Monsoon Pattern** refers to the occurrence of **two distinct monsoon phases** in a year that affect a region, particularly the **Northeastern States of India**.

- **Southwest Monsoon (June to September)**:  
    This is the **primary monsoon season** for most of India. The **Bay of Bengal branch** of the southwest monsoon brings heavy rainfall to the Northeastern States like **Assam, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh**.
- **Retreating/Post-Monsoon (October to December)**:  
    This secondary phase brings **additional rainfall**, especially to **Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura (NMMT region)**. This is often accompanied by **cyclonic storms** originating from the Bay of Bengal.

- The presence of both the **southwest monsoon** (June–September) and the **retreating/post-monsoon** (October–December) leads to a **prolonged rainy season**

- The **back-to-back monsoon cycles** put continuous pressure on **relief infrastructure**, emergency services, and **budgetary resources**

- The dual monsoon system makes it harder to plan and execute **infrastructure repair**, **agricultural recovery**, and **resettlement efforts**, as damage may recur within months. Eg: In **Arunachal Pradesh**, roads repaired after July landslides were again washed away during October rains in 2022, disrupting connectivity repeatedly.

Challenges
- The region is dominated by **mountainous landscapes**, **dense forests**, and **seismic zones**
- The presence of **international borders** with countries like **China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh** and historical instances of **insurgency** have led to delays in project execution due to **security concerns**
- Compared to other regions, the **Northeast has received less investment** in infrastructure due to **lower population density**

The government has deployed **NDRF units** across the **Northeast** and enhanced **IMD’s region-specific alerts** for **floods and landslides** in states like **Assam**, **Sikkim**, and **Arunachal Pradesh**.
Schemes like **NESIDS** support **critical infrastructure** such as **flood protection embankments**'
