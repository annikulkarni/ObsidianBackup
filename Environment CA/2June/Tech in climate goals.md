## **using cold plates and immersion cooling in data centres

- These methods reduce emissions by **15–21%** compared to traditional air cooling.
- liquid coolants transfer heat more efficiently than air. _Eg:_ Alibaba’s deployment of cold plate cooling led to lower power usage effectiveness (PUE)
- Water usage drops by **31–52%**, helping conserve freshwater resources _Eg:_ In water-stressed regions like Arizona, using cold plate cooling helps tech firms operate data centres

## **life cycle assessment aid in evaluating cooling technologies**

The **Microsoft-WSP study** assessed **cold plates** and **immersion cooling** from production to end-of-life, revealing their **overall environmental benefits**.

**LCA** highlights **sustainability trade-offs**, helping compare the **true impact** of different **cooling methods**

**LCA** provides **data-driven insights** for **industry and policymakers** to adopt **greener technologies**

When combined with **cold plates** or **immersion cooling**, renewables amplify environmental benefits by further lowering **energy and water use**

**Liquid-cooling** systems like **cold plates** and **immersion cooling** transfer heat more efficiently than air, reducing the risk of overheating and improving hardware performance
